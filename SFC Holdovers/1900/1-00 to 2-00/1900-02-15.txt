SIGNIFICANCE OF
THE NEW CAMPAIGN
LONDON. Feb. 15.-Lord Roberts has be
gun hi? operations against the Boer, army
between the Modder River and Kimber
ley by initiating a flanking movement,
which up to the present time has proven
successful. The drifts referred to in Lord
Roberts' official messages are all to the
east ol Methuen's camp on Modder River
and within the Free Ftate territory.
The flm move was made on Monday by
the mounted infantry brigade under Colo
nel Hannay. moving to Ramah. which, as
near as can be ascertained, is ten miles
almost due scuth of Jacobsdal.
On the same day General French, with a
large cavalry lorco, took Deklels Drift,
on Reit . River. Â»Ast of Modder River
camp, thus openhg the way of the Sixth
and Seventh divisi->ns under Kelly-Kenny
and Tucker, respectively.
French pushed ahÂ»ad swiftly on -Tues
day, marching twenty-five miles, forcing
the passage of the Hcdder at Clip Drift,
and occupying the hills on the north bank
and capturing: the Boer laagerfe there. All
this was done within tr<j space of six
hours.
General Gordon with th* cavalry bri
gade eeized two other driits, Rondeval
and another between It and Clip Drift.
The two infantry divisions ire now fol
lowing up the cavalry advance. With this
huge British force thieatoning his. left
wing on a position stretching from Spyt
fontein by Masersfonteln and by Jacobs-
ley and James Bryce and decided to open
a permanent fund to carry on a vigorous
political propaganda for the principles
thus enunciated.

lowing signed statement waa
given out this evening by
Charles E. Macruzn, former
United States Consul to Pre-
toria:
"The. situation .hi Pretoria, was sue*Â»
that first, as an official. I could not re
main there while my Government at
home' was apparently in the dark as to
the exact conditions In South Africa. Sec
ondly, as a man and citizen of the United
States. l could not remain in Pretoria, Sac
rificing my own self-respect and that off
the people of Pretoria while the Govern
ment at home continued to leave me in
the position of a British Consul and not
an American Consul. I want to say right
here that there was not a single- request
made of me through the Department of
State looking to the care of British Inter
ests In Pretoria which I did not fulfill
and report upon according to my orders.
On the other hand. American Interests In
South Africa were In that condition
which demanded that the Department oC
State should be cognizant of them.
"I issued the statement received from
the State Department that Americans
must remain neutral. In the face of this
Americans were continually going' to the
front and taking up arms in the cause of
the Boers. I could not help but know
that many of these were citizens of thÂ«
United States. I also knew that many
of them in utter despair at the attituda
of our own Government were taking tha
oath of allegiance to the Transvaal re
public "When affairs had reached that
state that my Vice Consul. Mr. Van Am
erlngen, closed up his business, took the
oath of allegiance to the republic and
went to the front as a burgher I thought
the time had come when I should maks
a report of these conditions.
"It was. over four weeks from the time
the war opened before I received a single
mall dispatch from my Government or a
personal letter. The mall for the Trans
vaal had all been stopped at Cape Town
by order of the High Commissioner. "When
this mall was finally forwarded to me af
ter Colonel Stowe. the Consul General at
Cape Town, had secured Its release I
had the humiliation, as the representa
tive of the American Government, of sit
ting In my office In Pretoria and looking
upon envelopes bearing the official seal
of the American Government opened and
officially sealed with a sticker notifying
me that the contents had been read by tha
censor at Durban.
"I looked up International law. but
failed to find anywhere that one military
power can use Its own discretion as to
forwarding the official dispatches of a
neutral Government to Its representative
In a besieged country.
"The. mall service from Delasroa Bay to
Europe was continually Interrupted by
the action of British men-of-war at that
port. The service was over two weeks
longer than by the west coast, and thera
Â¦were continual rumors that that port
would be closed and communication with
the outside world entirely cut off. Tha
cable service from the Transvaal was ab
solutely cut off, and I was privately In
formed by the Belgian and German Con
suls at Pretoria that their official cabled
In code to their Governments had been
refused by the censor. I filed one cable la
the Interest of an American In Pretoria,
which was refused absolutely by the cen
sor in Durban. .This cable I sent to thÂ«
fiancee of a Mr. Nelson, an American
business man In Pretoria. She was on her
way to South Africa from Buffalo. >Â». T..
when the war broke out. According to a
letter which Mr. Nelson received just be
fore the war commenced she was buying
her trosseau in Europe. The cable re
quested her to come by the east coast.
When I Informed Mr. Nelson that tha
cable had not been sent his brother took
the oath of allegiance to the republic and
went to the front. But these an simply
minor details. The misrepresentations)
which had been going on before the war
and after It opened were of such a. serious
nature and would require such detailed
explanation that on the 6th of Xovember
I filed a cable to the department In coda
stating that I wished leave of absence In
order to visit the States. I set forth In
this cable that my Vice Consul had enÂ«
listed In the Boer army; that a Mr. At.

LOXDOX, Feb. 14 (v:45
p. m .) â The War Office has
issued the following mes
sage from Lord Roberts, re
ceived this evening:
"Dekiel's Drift, Feb. 14, S:io
a. m. â General French left this
point at 1 1 '.30 yesterday morn
ing with three brigades of cav
alry, horse artillery and mounted
infantry, including several colo
nial contingents, in order to
seize a crossing of the Modder,
distant about twenty-five miles.
He reports by dispatch, dated
5:35 p. m., that he had forced ?.
passage at Clip Drift and has oc
cupied the hills north of the river,
capturing three of the. enemy s
laagers with their supplies, while
General Gordon, of the Fifteenth
Hussars, with his brigade, who
had. made, a feint at Rondeval
Drift, four miles west, has seized
it and another drift between it
and Clip Drift, together with two
more laagers.
"General French's perform-
ance is brilliant, considering the
excessive heat and a blinding
dust storm which raged during
the latter part of the day.
"Owing to the rapidity of his
movements General French met
with but slight opposition, his
losses being small. Lieutenant
Johnson of the Inniskilling Dra
goons is the only officer reported
severely wounded.
"The sixth division was last
night on the north bank of the
Reit at Waterval Drift, and is
moving to support the cavalry.
The seventh division is here and
will go on this afternoon.
'Tour officers and fifty-three
men had to be sent last evening
in the returning wagons to the
railway line, prostrated by heat
and exhaustion.
"The casualties were two
troopers killed, and Captain Ma
jesidie, of the Rifle Brigade,
wounded. He has since died.
One trooper was wounded."
The following dispatch has
been received at the War Office
from General Roberts:
"Reit River, Tuesday, Feb.
13. â Colonel Hannay, in com
mand of a brigade of mounted
infantry, marching from Orange
River to Ramah, had a slight en
gagement February 11 (Sun

tained the enemy while he
pushed his baggage and main
body through to Ramah. The
object of the march was success

killed, twenty-two were wound-

one had ventured to hope. Evidently he
ordered General MacDonald'B reconnols
sance to Koodoesberg In order to draw the
enemy's attention westward, away from
the contemplated move through the Free
State. The Boer army Is barred from the
direct route to Bloemfonteln. and even on
the road by Boshof It would be exposed
to a flank attack during the march.
General Cronje, on learning of Lord
Roberts' disposition on Tuesday and yes
terday, must have had an Interesting
problem. He had to consider whether to
hold on to his position at Jacobsdal at
Magersfonteln and to seize Klmberley, or
to raise the siege and move offâ and if
so In what direction, whether to Bloem
fontein or northward across the Vaal.
"This event forms the brilliant opening
of a new campaign which Is being marked
by concentration of purpose and by an
energy and rapidity that augur well for
the future. The public must wait patient

membering that the distance to be cov

Possibly enough there may be no general
action until Friday."

SALINAS, Feb. 14.â J. C. Molgaard, the
grocer, died by his own hands, but the
story of assault and robbery of Monday
Is Btlll "an 'deep, a mystery as- ever. Ac
cording to the verdict of the Coroner's
jury, death was caused by poison taken
in a fit of mental derangement, but even
though this Is a fact, there Is no conclu
sive proof that the man was not robbed.
Up to half an hour before his death Mol
gaard strictly maintained that he was as
saulted and relieved of several hundred
dollars, and since his demise there has
been no evidence to disprove his story-
His accounts with the firm, so far as
known, were practically all right. Mol
gaard was considered very conscientious
and was a temperate man.

PITTBBURO. Feb. 14.-The announce
ment in the papers to-day that the long
throatenrd clash of the steel kings had
been finally precipitated by H. C. Frick
i'.llng the widely heralded suit against
Andrew Carnegie and the Carnegie Steel
Company praying for an equitable ac
counting of the ex-chairman's etoclvhoiu
inps in the Kiaru steÂ«Â»l concern created a.
sensation in financial and manufacturing
circles here. The suit is regarded as the
most important ever filed in connection
with the Fteel business, and It Is said
more money Is at stake than in any legal
proceedings ever brought in this country
in which all the parties were simply citi
tphs. Steel manufacturers view the
trouble as a bitter personal struggle for
supremacy and are watching each move
with Intense Interest.
The ipgral talent called into action by
the suit is an array of the giants of the
profession in this State with luminaries
of national repute yet to be included.
On Mr. Frick> side are John G. John
son of Philadelphia. David L. Watson of
I'ittsburg and Willis F. McCook, for years
the personal counselor and intimate
friend of Mr. "Prick.
Strangely enough Attorney Watson is
the man who originally drew tip the now
lamous "Iron-clad agreement" for Andrew
Carnegie, which he has now been retained
to have declared invalid. It is said that
Jir. Watson spent the best part of three
months in drafting this Instrument and
declared that it was the strongest paper
of the kind he had ever formulated.
As yet little has come to light of trie
plans "made by Andrew Carnegie to de
fend his company's interests, although it
Is almost certain that iJalzell, Scott &
Gordon have been at work for days on the
defense. Prominent lawyers of NVw York
are mentioned as having been retained by
Mr. Carnegie, but Just who will really be
opposed to the legal array of Mr. Frick's
side cannot certainly be ascertained.
Andrew McCook said to-day that he
confidently expected the suit to come to
trial before midsummer an.d probably
much earlier.
At noon to-day no notice of the s>ult had
been served upon the defendants or their
counsel. Secretary Moreland of the Car
neg-ie Steel Company said that he had
not seen the bill and refused to talk about
It. When the company had anything to
give out. he said, it would come through
the regular channel. Dalzell. Scott &
Gordon, the defendants' counsel, were
equally reticent. President C. M. Schwab,
who is looked upon as Mr. Carnegie's per
sonal representative during his absence
from the city, left Washington. D. C, last
night. It is supposed that he 1s on his
way to see Mr. Carnegie, who Is at Dunge
"ness. Fernandlna, Fla.. visiting his sister
in-law. Mrs. Thomas M. Carnegie.
George Lauder, director and consulting
partner of the Carnegie company, who
stands very close to Mr. Carnegie, left
for the South a few days ago and is sup
posed to be with Mr. Carnegie at Dunge
ness.
FERNANDINA, Fla.. Fob. 14.â Andrew
Carnegie Is with his sister-in-law. MrÂ«.
Lucy Carnegie, at Dungenefis, on Cum
berland Island. An effort made to see Mr.
Carnegie failed. Colonel Page, manager
of Mrs. Carnegie's estate, informed the
reporter that Mr. Carnegie positively de
clined to be interviewed relative to the
suit filed against him In Plttsburgr by H.
C. Frick. Mr. Carnegie is visiting here
for rest and recuperaton and It is un
derstood that one of his attorneys is with
him at Dungeness. .''â¢ :: .

Acting, on the recommendation of Quar
termaster General Ludlngton. the Secre
tary of War has. ordered the establish
ment of a bi-monthly transport -system
between Sa-n Francisco and Manila. This
action is due to the heavy traffic between
the points caused by the active military
operations In the Philippines and is
prompted by a desire to leave nothing un
done that will . contribute to the health
and comfort of the troops In the Islands.-
The service will be started by the troop
ship Sherman, which will leave San Fran
clsco for Manila on the 15th or 16th lnst.,
to be followed at regular Intervals âof
about fifteen days by other large ships of
the Pacific transport fleet, Including .the
Sheridan, Grant, Logan, Thomas and

sidering the advisability of establishing a
monthly service <Jn similar lines bet-ween
New York and Manila over the Mediter

WOMEN FIGHT
WITH HAT PINS
Duel in Which a Nose
Is Bitten Off.
Special Cable to The Call and New Tork Her
ald. Copyrighted. 1300, by the New York
Herald Company.
PARIS.' Feb. 14.â Marie Guerln of Mar
seilles and a rival girl from Bordeaux
both frequented oafos In the evenings
with the sequel that a dispute was de
cided by a duel. Each had seconds.
When Marie's second gave the signal to
commence both women had taken oil* their
hats and used hat pins, considered a regu
lar Paris weapon. Their skirts were
tucked up to give freedom of movement.
The Bordelais was bigger and stronger.
Both rolled about in thetstreet, fighting
like demons. They were surrounded by
an admiring crowd. Marie, finding her
self getting beaten, pretended to run
away, but suddenly turned and sprang at
her adversary, who 'was receiving con
gratulations of victory. They clinched
and Marie bit off her adversary's nose.
The combatants were separated and every
one tried to find the nose.
"It's not necessary, I've swallowed It."
said Marie. ,
Yesterday she was sentenced to eight
een months in prison. The sentence waa
severe because this was a repetition of an
offense some time ago, when Marie had
bitten very severely a man on the arm.
PARTISANSHIP AT
THE CONFERENCE
Anti-Trust Delegates in
a Furor.
CHICAGO. Feb. 14.-^Stormy scenes
characterized the sessions of the National
Anti-Trust Conference preceding the final
adjournment to-night. The climax came
when Delegate Joseph Parker, a middle
of-the-road Populist, surprised the con
ference with a resolution pledging the
delegates to vote for no party that did
not stand for Government ownership and
the principle of direct legislation. Tho
Democratic leaders Interpreted this as
an attack on W. J. Bryan and were on
their feet in an instant to block the move.
A score of delegates took the floor and all
tried to talk at tho same time. -
"You must not stifle free speech here,
was shouted. â¢
"Everybody must be heard, came from
a delegate in the gallery.
Chairman Monnett was in doubt as to
what to do. Disorder reigned for ten min
utes and then Chairman Monnett used the
gavel and temporarily adjourned the con
vention. ,â¢ , , ,Â¦
Another whirl of excitement took place
after the reading of the report of the
committee on resolutions, when Delegate
Quinn of Illinois offered an amendment to
the declaration of principles calling for
the repeal Of all laws sustaining the right
of citizens to private property, with a
view to giving every citizen a free home.
A long wrangle ensued over the disposi
tion of the amendment. Captain W. P.
Black. Tom L. Johnson and others ap
pealed to Qulnn to withdraw the amend
ment, but he refused.
After much discussion, during which
Quinn was denounced as a disturber by
delegates on the stage, Chairman Monnett
-put the motion to adopt the report.- Ho
was in doubt and two ballots were taken.
Finally he declared the report of the com
mittee adopted, and the ruling caused a
thundex of disapproval. Delegate Qulnn
during the uproar appealed from the deci
sion of the chair and his motion was sec
onded The vote was put and Chairman
Monnett was sustained by a large major
ity â¢
A strong attempt was made at the con
ference to-day to offset the partisan effect
of the resolutions adopted yesterday, de
nouncing the pending currency bill. Frank
B. Monnett, permanent chairman of the
conference, made a speech In which he
declared that the movement for public
ownership of public utilities was being
carried on by the Republican party, as
well as by the Democratic party.
"In the Republican Northwest." said he.
"6Â» per cent of the public utilities are
owned by the public, whereas in the many
Southern Democratic States less than 5
per cent are so owned. I would remind
the convention that Ohio, which Is the
State of the President, is also the State of
the author of the Sherman anti-trust act.
If we have an Attorney General Griffgn
we also had an Attorney General Olney."
The; convention .was enlivened also by
an attack by Professor Bemis on. "Uni
versities Whose Endowments Come From
Tryst Magnates." The professors in these
institutions, said the ex-professor of po
litical economy at . Chicago University.
"do their best, but cannot overcome this
handicap." As a remedy- he advocated the
establishment through tho State Legislat
ure of chairs In State universities devoted
to the study of the trust question. Â¦
A number of set speeches were heard at
the morning and afternoon sessions, and
the nieht session, which wound up the
three days' conference, heard as many of
the remaining speeches as could be read
In the time that was left. ..
In reply to this dispatch, which was for
warded without delay, I received from the
department a reply advising that my pres
ence at Pretoria was important to public
interests. On the gth -I telegraphed again
acknowledging the receipt of the cable,
advising the department that the situa
tion was not critical, that Mr. Atterbury
was competent and that my presence in
America was Important. No reply was
received and I wired again on the 11th,
etaxing that no reply had been received
*nd again urged a favorable reply. No
reply was received to this. On the 14th
of November I again wired the depart
ment, stating that I could not leave with
out permission; that I would forfeit my
post if the reasons which J would make
to the department did not prove satisfac
tory. The cable was delayed by the cen
sor until the 2d of December, when I had
advices that It had just been forwarded.
On the lMh of November I again filed a
cable, stating that three of my cables had
been unanswered and stating that a sub
stitute would answer as Consul during my
absence, and requested a reply. To this I
received a reply immediately, which was
a reiteration of the reply to my first
cable. Upon receipt of this reply, which
was on the 20th of November. I imme
diately wrote to the department accepting
the refusal to grant my leave and stating
In that letter that I would abide by the
decision of the department and attempt
to convey an Intelligent idea for the de
partment's guidance of the conditions
there In mail dispatches. On the 4th of
December I received a reply from the de
partment to my cablegram of the 14th,
which I had been Informed two days pre
viously had just been forwarded. It read
a? follows:
" 'You may come home. Put Atterbury
temporarily in charge. Department will
send mail from here.' This was signed
'Hay.' Thereupon I cabled the depart
ment as follows: 'Sail lsth, by Naples."
"This cablegram was sent on the 6th,
and in the meantime I prepared to go. A
few days later I received a telegram
from Mr. Hollls, Consul at Delagoa Bay,
stating that he had been instructed to
come to Pretoria to take charge of my
office during my absence, and until a
man should arrive from Washington. Mr.
'Hollls arrived on the 14th of December
and was thoroughly posted In the routine
of the office, and I introduced him to the
heads of all Government departments
and to my consular colleagues. I left
Pretoria the night of December 16. I
Â¦went straight to Paris, notified the de
partment of m>' presence there while
waiting for the American line boat to sail
for New York. I arrived in Washington
on Monday, February 5, and reported to
Assistant Secretary Hill of the State De
partment, who officially informed me that
Secretary Hay's son had been appointed
in my place and that he was on his way
to Pretoria.
"I appreciated the seriousness of the
conditions in South Africa to the extent
that on my way to Washington, believing
that I was Btlll the Consul in Pretoria. I
refused to make â¢ any statement that
would In any way Involve the department
or embarrass it. My one object was to
lay the information before the depart
ment as to the true state of affairs In
South Africa. If the department thought
these facts were of value sufficient to
warrant the expense of the trip I had
taken I expected to be remunerated and
return to Pretoria, leaving the department
to act as It saw fit upon the facts which
I laid before it. ,-Â¦;Â¦â¢Â¦â¢
"Instead of this I find that Secretary
Hay. whether actini? upon the reports In
the newspapers, or upon advice from the
British Government, or some other mo
tive, I dorf't know, saw fit not to wait
until I could present my reasons in per
son, and has been a silent or conniving
partner to discrediting reports of my
official acte. I come home to find an at
tempt has been made tt> tear down my
personal reputation. I wish to state right
here that when I accepted my, post as
Consul I knew nothing of any secret al
liance between America and Great Brit
ain, and that I had seen nothing in the
regulations which made the Consul of the
American republic subject to the whims
and caprices of .an English military cen
sor at Durban. I came to America with
a motive of which I am not ashamed.
"There is not one soul who can point to
a slnple official act of mine which depart
ed from the strictest neutrality. My con
fidential dispatches to the department
contained information which will show
my sympathy for the republic, but which
time will prove to be unbiased as to ac
tual facts. My acts as a public officer
are all recorded at the department. My
acts now as a private man can in no
way involve the public service, and I sim
ply make this statement In my own de
fense as against those which have come
from the department, secretly and offi
cially. CHARLES E. MACRUM."

been throwing up defensive works from
Trichards Drift and the Spion Kop range
eastward to the Hianrwana and Monte

THE LATE JOHN T. PORTER.
9~* $-f-Â®-+-Q-+~s-+-Q-+-<s-+-Â®~*-9
WATSONVILLE, Feb. 14.-John
T. Porter, a pioneer resident of
Pajaro Valley, died at his resi
dence, in Pajaro. at 11:30 o'clock
last night. His health had been
failing for some time, but on Friday last
he was stricken with paralysis, which
caused his death.
John T. Porter was born in Duxbury,
Mass.. in 1830. When gold was discovered
In California he sailed from Boston to the
new El Dorado, and was among the many
daring spirits who tempted fortune in the
Golden West. He was not a stranger to
the Vicissitudes of life and experienced
the ups. and downe of the pioneer's ca
reer.
.He came to Santa Cruz County in 1834
and, engaged In mercantile and agricul
tural Â¦ pursuits. In 1856 he was elected
Sheriff at the time when the county was
infested with disreputable criminals.
During the two terms he held the office
of Sheriff John T. Porter brought many of
the outlaws to justice ami inspired tho
rest with ' a wholesome respect for the
law. Mr. Porter was appointed Collector
of the port of Monterey by President Lin
cdln and discharged the duties of that
office most creditably until 1565, when he
resumed business. He was a manager of
the State Insane Asylum at Agnews for
several year 3 and his last public office,
was Supervisor of Pajaro Township, Mon
terey County. It can be truthfully said of
him that he was faithful to every trust
reposed in him. He was a stanch Repub
lican and was always a safe adviser in
the councils of his party.
Mr. Porter had large landed interests
In various parts of the State, and he was
recognized' as one of the prominent finan
ciers of the county. He was one of the
founders of the Pajaro Valley Bank, and
was president of that Institution at the
time of his death.
He has been peculiarly happy In his do
mestic relations, and his closing hours
were poothed by the tender ministrations
of a devoted wife, his son. Warren R.
Porter, and his daughter, Mrs. Florence
Pflngst.
The funeral services will be held in the
MaÃonie Temple at Watsonville under the
auspices of Pajaro Lodge, F. and A. M.
The body will be interred in Cypress
Lawn Cemetery, San Francisco, on the
arrival of the Monterey express, Friday
morning.

Bill Prepared, and With the Money

Special Dispatch to. The Cflll
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Feb. 14.â
The report of the California Debris Com
mission is one of great intereet to, the
miners of California as it is upon one
of the subjects to which the California
Miners'' Association has devoted much
time and energy. It has occupied the
attention of the debris commission since
1596 and is the result of several extensive
and elaborate investigations upon the
part of very competent and distinguished
engineers comprising the commissioners
and the field engineers immediately under
them.
The proposed project of IS9S, which was
founded upon the principle of the con
struction, at Narrows of a stone dam, is
abandoned by the commission for the rea
son that the amount of debris that couM
be restrained thereunder would not be
Â¦ commensurate with, the expenditure re
! quired to obtain material results. The
I project of IK*9 is the one approved by the
| commission, chief of engineers and Bee
: retary of War. It consists of a series of
dams constituting restraining barriers*
Land forming impounding reservoirs in and
about and â¢ above and below De Guorre
Point, to the extent of 2.000,000 acres dt
settling basin, with lateral outlets, ami
In the present project calculated to im
pound 50,000,000 cubic yards of debris.
The project likewise touches on the con
fining of a portion of- the Yuba River to
a single channel so as to avoid to a great
extent the flowing down the Yuba Kiver
of existing debris. It is an admittedly
novel project, comprehensive and com
plete in detail, showing great study and
I careful elaborations.
i The commission expressly states that
the works outlined in the report contem
plate only the restraining and impound
ing of the debris already deposited In the
Yuba River and suggest that the project
| is such that its feasibility is being demon
strated and that the works are competent
for the purposes intended and this being
proven by tne experience of time the im
pounding of new debris can be then un
dertaken. In this respect the report is
conservative. It indicates a disposition to
observe the rights of the farmer and at
the same time furnishes much hope to
the miner to be secured through the con
servative force of experimental proced
ure. The expert estimates the cost of
constructing the works at present advlKod
at $600,000. Xt recites several acts of Con
gress authorizing and directing such
work. Including several provisions en
acted for the assistance of the same dur
. Ing the last Congress at the Instance of.
Representative de Vrles, who has made
this subject a careful study during his
service in Congress.
The commission asks for a construction
of certain portions of various acts
under which it has proceeded ana
is to proceed. It is of the opinion
that part of the work should be
done by day labor and part by contract.
The authorization to do the work in this
manner, as well as the authorization to
look to California for half of the cost in
either case, was enacted during the last
Congress by provisions Inserted in the
river and harbor bill, and prepared by
Representative de Vries. There is now
to the credit of the project $500,000, $250,000
of which is the State . fund, the balance
constituting the Federal fund. Â¦
The commission asks if,it has authority
to purchase lands with Federal funds, and
if ft can proceed, with the work with the
I amount now on hand, or whether or not
it must wait until the JSOO.OOO is available
before proceeding. Representative de
Vries when seen to-night concerning the
report stated that its contents were
known to him, and that after consulta
tion with Senator Perkins he had al
ready prepared a measure which he will
introduce in the House, to-morrow, and
which Senator Perkins will intro
duce in the Senate, empowering the
Secretary of War to purchase the neces
sary lands *for the sites of the works and
authorizing the secretary to proceed at
once with the construction of these with
the $500,000 available. ' '
"Undoubtedly," said Mr. de Vries, "this
is more money than actually will be used
by the commission before the short ses
sion of Congress in December, at which
time the river and harbor bill will be pre
sented, and In which provision can be
Â¦made for the balance of the nation's pro
portion of the moneys necessary to com
plete the works."

John D. Rockefeller and Louis A.
Hall to Se Made Defendants
in the Action by the
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOISE, Idaho. Feb. 14.â An upheaval In
Idaho railroad circles occurred to-day
that will result in suits aggregating .a
million and in sensational developments.
In these suits Louis A. Hall, the Michi
gan lumberman, and John D. Rockefeller
will be made defendants. The plaintiff
will be the Merrltts, father and son. who
not long ago secured a Judgment in Michi
gan against Rockefeller for over $900,000.
Tho trouble has arisen by the dismissal
from the Pacific and Idaho Northern Rail
road, of which Hall is president, of all
the Merrltts and their friends, the ax
having been wielded by P. P. Shelby, the
general manager, whom the Merritts
have been trying to decapitate officially
for Borne time.
Shelby charges they have been using
the railroad to cover up questionable
real estate transactions, operating a land
department with which the railroads has
no connection. The manager has Installed
new men in all places vacated excepting
chief engineer, whose office has been
placed in charge of the Janitor tempor
arily. The whole affair "has created
something of a sensation here, as the
Merritts have posed as the financial
backbone of the railroad.
General Manager Shelby is here to-night
and in reply to the charges of mismanage
ment he says the Pacific and Idaho
Northern is paying operating expenses
and Interest on the basis of bonds at J20.
000 a mile. ThiÃ revenue is all from the
shipment of ore from the Seven Devils
Country, which runs 45 to 55 per cent a
ton In copper and $20 in gold. This ore
is shipped to New York for smelting.
G. R. Shaw has succeeded F. L: Rich

FEDERAL COURT REFUSES
TO INTERFERE IN FIGHT
No Change in the Kentuckn Controversy,
. and Taglor Continues to Hold
tne Fort.
- CINCINNATI, Feb. 14.â 1n the Circuit :
Court of the United States Judge W. N.
Tart this afternoon denied the motion for
a preliminary Injunction in both of the
cases from Kentucky. In addition to the
attorneys In the cases most of the mem
bers Of the far or Cincinnati, Covtngton
and Newport were present and the court
room was unable to hold all others want
ing admission.
While the court held that no Injunction
Â¦would issue under th^se bills, yet It also
held that after the case had been heard
In the State courts they could get in on er
ror for review In the United. States Supreme
Court. After the decision was announced
former Governor Bradley and his associ
ate counsel stated that they were unable
least. Several of them expressed personal
willingness to return to Frankfort.
LOUISVILLE Ky.. Feb. 14.â Suit was
filed In the Circuit Court this afternoon
by counsel for Taylor seeking to restrain
J. C. Wi BecKhara from acting as Gov
ernor and General John B. Castlemun
from attempting to discharge the duties
of adjutant general. Summons Wai
served on the defendants this afternoon.
The suit will be allotted to one of the Cir
cuit Judges by a drawing. This draw-
In; may not be held for several days.
When It Is held an application for a. re-
Straining order will be made. The suit
is brought by Governor Taylor for hlm
?elf Individually and a? Governor of Ken
tucky. - . -
to say what would be the next step of thÂ©
Republican State officers Of Kentucky.
Counsel for the plaintiffs held a. long con
sultation in the law library after the an
nouncement of the decision, and said they
had no doubt either of the ultimate pos
sibility of a hearing of these cases in the
United States court as indicated by Judge
Taft or of the final result, but at present
counsel could not say what would be the
next procedure. .
In announcing his decision Judge Taft
said:
"I should have been able to decide this
question at the close of the argument, but
the Importance of the interests involved
and the outrageous character of the elec
toral ? frauds under the forma or law
which the bills charge that the State con
test board is aLout to consummate have
let me give the question presented a
fuller and more careful investigation.
This has only confirmed my rirst tmpres
sion and requires me to make an order
denying the motion for a preliminary in
junction in both cases."
FRANKFORT. Ky.. Feb. 14.â The action
of Judge Taft in Cincinnati to-day deny
ing Federal jurisdiction in the contests
for the minor places on the State ticket
did not discourage Governor Taylor In the
least. He contends that the matter has
nothing whatever to do with his own case.
Governor Taylor said: "I never really
belleved that the matter could be made
to stick in the court before Judge Taft,
but we felt obliged to try it. This is a
case where all the lejral remedies must bÂ«Â»
tried and exhausted If necessary. We will
try everything that the courts afford us."
The suit of Beckham vs. Taylor for the
possession of the office of Governor was
filed to-day In the Circuit Court at Frank
fort. Up to a late hour the Sheriff had
not succeeded in serving notice on Gov
ernor Taylor and the chances of his do
ing so did not seem bright, as all visitors
to the office of the Governor, or to the
gubernatorial mansion, were compelled to
run a gauntlet of guards who were on the
lookout for gentlemen with suspicious
papers. The petition in the suit holds
that W. S. Taylor is not the Governor of
the State and that with an armed force
he holda possession of the executive
building. It alleges that he is drawing
money without authority of law from the
State treasury, pardoning convicts and
doing other things that are detrimental
to the welfare of the State. The peti
tion asks that the court enjoin him from
exercising any duties as chief executive
and from assuming any control whatever
over the Legislature. Application for the
injunction will be made on Friday before
Judge Cantrill at Georgetown.
The committee of the Democratic mem
bers of the Legislature which came from
Louisville for the purpose of investigating
conditions here; and determining whether
it is safe for the Democrats to venture
within the precincts of . Frankfort, re
turned to Louisville to-night. The mem
bers of the committee declined to hold
any conversation with Adjutant General
Collier or Governor Taylor, and made
Custodian Thompson of the executive
building the go-between. They first sent
word to Governor Taylor that before the
Democratic members could think of re
turning to Frankfort the soldiers must be
sent away. No objection.' they said, could
be raised to a small number for aya v body-
Fuard for Governor Taylor personally. As
or tho Legislature, it needed no protec-
Governor Taylor replied through the
medium of Custodian Thompson that the
request of the committee could not be
compiled with, but promised that the Leg
islature should not be molested in any
way. For the committee. Custodian
Thompson then asked Governor Taylor if
the same conditions would exist next
Monday around the State House as ex
isted to-day. Mr. Thompson was sent
back with the reply that no assurance
could be given, but that there would be no
show of force and that all the soldiers
would be withdrawn from the gates and
would be kept in the background as much
as possible.
The members of the committee said
that In their opinion the meetings would
continue In Louisville for the present at
TREATY RIGHTS OF ALIENS.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14.â The Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations to-day
authorized a favorable report on the bill
providing punishment for violations of
the treaty rights of a.Hens. The bill au
thorizes proceedings in the United States
courts in cases of assaults upon aliens.
Foraker, in his report, places the motive
for the bill on the Ignorance of foreign
governments concerning our internal af
fairs He urges the wisdom of conferring
jurisdiction upon the United States
courts, and says that to do so will not
interfere with the jurisdiction of the
State courts.
"It seems obvious, says the report,
"that the Government of the United
States should be in a situation to enforce
its treaty stipulations and accord the pro
tection to aliens which it guarantees."
"Railroad Back."
A railroad engineer called on me a few
weeks ago, complaining of a dull ache
and stiffness in hi 9 back. A.s he sat in tho
i chair he gradually slid down until the
| small of his back rested on the seat. That,
I he said, was the only position in which he
| felt easy. My Dr. McLaughlln Electric
Belt cured him in eleven days. His back
ia now limber and free of pain. I have
i cured thousands of "railroad back." !

RUSSIA MOVING

. ? '
Belief That She Intends
to Take Herat.
LONTJOX, Feb. 15.â The St. Petersburg
correspondent of the Times, remarking
that "It will not do to place overmuch
reliance upon Russia's official assurance
that nothing will be done to embarrass
England In the present situation of af
fairs," gives additional details showing
that tbe delays in the ordinary traffic on
the 1 Central Asian Railway are not
caused, as has been officially stated, by
snowfalls, but are due to the passage of
Russian troops, estimated at 20,000. who
are being concentrated in the vicinity of
Kushk. The correspondent adds that
"most Russians are convinced that Rus
sia intends, soon or late, to take Herat."
The Times In an editorial upon the dis
patch says: "This may not portend any
Immediate action, but it can hardly -be
doubted that Russia has come to the con
clusion that the psychological moment
has arrived when pressure can be brought
to bear on Great Britain.
"There la no reasoo to suppose that the
estimate of 20,000 troops la above the
mark. It does not follow, however, that
this lmplleÃ an advance on Herat. Prob
ably the demonstration Is Intended to
cover movements of & more practical Kin^
In other quarters.
"Looking to the eagerness of the Ger
mans to declare through their newspapers
that they are not at all afraid of the
extension of Influence In Persia, together
with German Interests In Western Asia
in connection with the Bagdad scheme,
.we must be prepared to derend our in
terests In the Persian Gulf and Southern
Persia against the whole world."

TWO MEN COMMIT SUICIDE
Bixon Lewis Lee.
Dixon Lewis Lee, a clerk In the freight
auditor's department of the Southern Pa
cific, residing at the corner of Seventeenth
and Bryant streets, committed suicide at
noon yesterday by shooting: himself In the
head while bathing in one or the tubs at
the Harbor View Baths. His body was
discovered later and was taken to the
MorjfUÂ© by Deputy Coroners Smith and
Brown. Mrs. Lee was interviewed and
Stated that she Knew of no cause that
would impel her husband to take his life.'
He had, however, been drinking of late,
and it Is believed that he drove the bullet
into his brain while temporarily insane
from the effects of the liquor.
Lee was 33 years of age and had been
In the employ Of the railroad for the past
few years. Recently he cultivated a taste
for drink, and had often been found Â¦want-
Ing in his duties. His home was always
mad* cheerful for him "and his wlf e and
only daughter sought to cure him of his
morning' he did not go to
work, but instead boarded a car for Har
bor View, where he intended to work oft
the effects of a drunk. He entered one
of the bathing apartments about noon
and. locked the door after him. At half
past 1 O'clock several persons about the
lilace heard a shot, but from the fact that
there were duck huntera near the place
they did not believe that It came from the
baths. About 5 o'clock an investigation
was. made and. when the. door of Lee's
apartment was broken down It was found
that he had placed a 38-caliber revolver
against his left temple . and pulled the
trigger. * Â¦
Among Lee's effects were found letters
from Supervisor Duboce, Attorney F.
Bert and Owen>Wade.' To the latter two
gentlemen he Had addressed communica
tions soliciting their Influence, In "securing
for 'him a : legislative position. It may
have, been that Lee's failure to secure
that for which, he sought prompted him
In killing himself. The Coroner will
bold an Inquest ' over the remains. â¢

out of the way the discussion proceeded
on the amendment brought in by the
Finance Committee providing that pro
visions of the bill are not Intended to
place any obstacles in the way of inter
national bimetallism. The Democratic
Senators arraigned the liepublicans for
reporting the amendment, declaring thÂ«y
were' insincere and that the proposition
was Intended to hoodwink the people and
to catch votes. No vote on the amend
ment was reached. The final vote on the
amendment and the bill will be taken
Borne time to-morrow.
When the debate opened Teller was
recognized to reply to the speech of Alli
son, delivered yesterday. He had waited
In vain, he said, for an explanation of the
House bill, which w.u? technically the
measure under consideration. He ap
proached all questions relating to the
finances of the cour.tr>' with suspicion. He
thought the House bill ought to be con-
Kidered carefully, as it might possibly be
come the law. It had been drafted by a
commission of acute lawyers and there
were force and strength behind it. Teller
took strong issue with Allison, who
claimed that the United State 6 was now
on the gold standard. He said:
V\> are not on the crold standard, except by
the unauthorized action of the treasury. We
ere en what Is sometimes called a llmpln* sil
ver standard, and sometimes a limping: gold
eumfiard.
Nobody outside of the United States hak
considered us as on the Â£-".A standard, but
it may be said that wÂ« practically have been
rorced by executive usurpation and transgres
sion of the law to proceed as If we were on a
Cold rter.-icri.
Teller declared that this pending bill
Â¦was to be enacted Into law because the
Fold standard advocates were afraid that
the American people would put some man
In the White House who would not favor
the gx>!d standard, the purpose being to
t-mbody the gold standard into the
etatutes, so that it could not be disturbed
without great difficulty. Teller said there
never had been an hour since 1579, even
In the severest panics, when there was
the slightest doubt that the greenbacks
would be redeemed in gold. lie main
tained, therefore, that thera was no rea
son for the legislation proposed in the
pending measure.
-In conclusion Teller eaid that the Re
publican party had abandoned its prin
ciple?, which were the greatest good for
the greatest number. It had fallen into
evil hands and was being used by evil
influences.
"There is no hope," said he. "for the
country from. it. Its policy Â¦will be dic
tated from the greatest commercial cen
ters and be overborne and weighed down
by prred."
The Republican party, he said, had come
into existence as a protest against
Flavery. The agencies which controlled It
DOW would not allow it to stand for right
eousness and Justice. He Eaid that Depew
in suggesting "gt>ld End glory" as a
proper motto for the Republican banner
had not proposed a phrase that had ever
!.f-en a rallying cry of the party. The
people would rise In their might and tear
down that banner unless the Republican
leaders placed upon it the old slogan of
"justice, riphteousness and equality of all
thÂ« people."
Chancier of New Hampshire then pro
posed his amendment to the committee
amendment relative to bimetallism. The
Chandler proposition authorized the Pres
ident to appoint commissioners to any in
ternational conference called by the
United States or any other country to ar
range a bimetallic agreement,
Wolcott suggested that this was the ex
isting law and asked Chandler to with
draw the amendment, but Chandler de
clined, saying that if the amendment were
existing law it could do no harm to
adopt it.
Vest of Missouri announced his purpose
to vote against both the Aldrich amend
ment and the Chandler amendment to it.
because he regarded the proposition for
an international conference as a fraud
and a pretext, Just as was the adoption
of the McEnery resolution after the rati
fication of tiie Paris treaty, which was
merely for the purpose of supplying some
Senators with a shallow ford over which
to cross the stream and had since been
entirely ignored. The Intention of the
pending bill was to kill silver and it
woulii prove as effective In that ofllce as
a das-;- â¢ or a dose of prussic acid. would
be in .-posing of animal life. It would
be absurd to send a commission abroad
asking lor a bimetallic conference in view
of the declaration for gold. 'â¢Â¦-'.>
Aldrich declared that Chandler was de
ceiving no one with his amendment and
was sure that the proposition was not
one that would meet with general ap
proval of the population.
Stewart referred to the measure as a
subterfuge and said he would not sup
port it.
Lindsay of Kentucky said If there were
any virtue in the present bill it was that
it settled the question of finance. He did
not believe in lncumbering the bill with
either the committee or the Chandler
amendment. Now was the time, he be
lieved, for the definite determination of
the financial question, and it could not be
determined if only a half-way law were
enacted. The amendments were either
unnecessary, in view of existing law, or
were not offered In good faith.
Caffery of Louisiana said the country,
in his opinion, had been on a gold stan
dard since IST3, and this bill was intended
merely to perpetuate It.
"The battle of the standards," declared
CaJYery, "was -fought and lost by the sil
verttes in ISS6. The political contest this
year will be only a skirmish. The forces
of the stlverltes have been routed and
their efforts to uphold silver must meet
with failure."
The amendment. In the opinion of
Money of Mississippi was entirely perti
nent, but he was satisfied there was no
desire on the part of the administration
or the Republican Senators to advance the
interests of bimetallism.
Teller said the Republican press
throughout the country was opposed to
the bimetallic amendment. He said it
would be ridiculous to put such an
amendment on this bill, as it would have
no force or effect. It was trifling with a
grave question simply to catch votes. It
was a gTeat letting down on the part of
the Finance Committee and a childish
treatment of the subject.
The vote was taken on Chandler's
amendment to the committee amendment.
It was defeatedâ 4s to 25â as follows:
Teas â Allen, Bate, Berry, Butler, Chandler,
Chilton. Clay, Cockrell, Culberson, Harris,
Heitfeld, Jones of Arkansas, Jones of Nevada,
Kenny. McEnery. Mania Money. Morgan. Pet

Chandler then asked Aldrlch if ho
would consent to the Insertion before
ths Finance Committee's amendment of
the words of the national platform of the
Republican party of 1592:
The United States, from tradition and Inter
ett, favors blmetallsm.
He would vote for the measure If bis
proposition were accepted.
"I object," replied Aldrlch, "to the re
enactment of the Revised Statutes and to
the recital In this bill of the various plat
forms of political parties."
He maintained there was no provision
In the bill which was an obstacle to bi
metallism.
Allen of Nebraska, declared the bill was
a gold measure from core to cuticle and
that It would be necessary to repeal the
bill In order to obtain bimetallism.
Rawllns of Utah said the bill was prac
tically a declaration against bimetallism.
Allison suggested that the trouble with
Senators on the Democratic side was that
they were not bimetallists. They stood
for the free and unlimited coinage of sil
ver and were silver monometallists. He
gald there was not a single line or syllable
in this bill which put in the pathway of
international bimetallism a single ob
stacle. He did *ot think it would be wise
for the United States to make another
proposition to Europe for an international
bimetallic agreement, but he believed that
the United States ought to -wait for other
nations to take the initiative and be pre
pared to receive their advances.
Jones of Arkansas expressed his sur
prise that the bimetallic amendment had
not been made a part of the bill when the
latter was reported. He believed it was
an afterthought and had been brought by
demands of Kepublican bimetallists.
"It is the same old fraudulent straddle,"
he declared, "that was put into the Re
publican platform of 1526 in order to drive
the voters."
The reason for the presentation of the
Senate substitute was that the House
measure was too specific and placed the
country too squarely on the sold standard
to suit the present straddlers. who by the
pending amendment sought to hoodwink
the people as they had been hoodwinked
in the past.
"I want to put a question to the Senator
from Rhode Island," said Cockrell. "I
want him to answer It as an honest man,
as a 'good Indian.' "
He then Inquired what he would take
for 15,000 ounces of silver In London if this
Congress should pass a free coinage of
n !lvÂ»r las < .
silver law. â¢ ,
AMrlch replied that he would doubtless
ask *1 29 an ounce for It If he could eret It.
but it was doubtless true that the
amount of silver poured Into the United
States would cause the price to drop to its
Cockrell declared that all the 6llver that
could come to this country under a free
colnace law would be easily absorbed by
the tnlted States and said that not the
FHshtest difficulty would be experienced
in maintaining the value of the silver dol
lar.
At 8:45 p. m. the Senate adjourned.
HOUSE PROCEEDINGS.
Missouri Representatives Eng-ag-e in
a Warm Argument.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14.â 1t was the In
tention of - the Republican leaders of the
House to call up the Porto Rlcan tariff
bill to-morrow, but there was such a. de
mand for time to discuss various ques
tions during the genera) debate upon the
legislative, executive and judicial appro
priation bill, -which was called up to-day,
that Payne gave notice that he would al
low the Porto Itlcan bill to go over until
Monday.
The debate upon the !eidsla.tlve bill to
day strayed far rrom the bill, touching
the question of Government deposits in
national banks, reckless expenditures for
pensiors and finally drifting Into the
question of methods In Missouri.
Bartholdt of Missouri raised the latter
question by attacking the Nesbltt law,
and provoked a long reply from Benton
of Missouri, who In turn aroused Pearce
of Missouri. Some very caustic things
were said on both sides.

IT WAS SO
EASY FOR
ST. CASIMIR
Majority of Books Held Cor
rigan's Horse Out â Five
Favorites Won.
From all sources It Is said that Ed. Cor
rigan, the ex-ruler of Hawthorne, fs pafily
in need of funds. It only requires a glance
at the conditions of the races at Tanforan
Park to confirm euch rumor. The con
dltlons of the fifth event, a five-furlong
sprint, read: "For three-year-olds that
have never won a sweepstake." Would
anything bo supremely ridiculous be tol
erated on an Eastern track? Not for an
instant! The average Caltfornian Is a
dullard, and it needs a dynamite shell to
wake him up. This specially prepared
stipulation was made for Corrlgan's St.
Caslmlr. Only two or three of the books
laid a price against him. St. Gaeimir
won stepping: sideways. Sent away
lengths behind, Diomed, the second
choice, finished In the place.
The card was a poor one, and the at
tendance light Favorites took four rae*s.
I^orford, the big bay colt from the-HSald
wln stable, made a gallop of the opening
six-furlonj? sprint. Played from 6 to' 2
down to even money, Spencer had him un
der restraint from the start. Silver Tall
led Racetto out three lengths for the
place.- .
An outsider upset all calculations In th 4
event following. Hoyal Prize, a 20 to 1
chance, ridden by Vlttltoe, collared Tor
sina. the pacemaker, in the stretch, beat
ing the mare put over a length. Fashion
Plate, which started for the flrst time In
many moons, and was hammered down to
9 to 5 favoritism, finished fifth.
Thirteen selling platers started in the
third event, with Corrlgan'a Afghan
starting; a prcftiounced favorite. Away
fifth to a ragged start, the big chestnut
caught Mafada seventy yards from the
wire, winning very handily. Rlcardo,
away flying, stopped badly, though last
ing long enough to take the show.
Everything favored. Tempo, favorite for
the mile and a quarter run. Before the
stretch was reached' Owyhee. the second
choice, broke down, and Tempo won by
himself. Vlnctora came fast, the last part.
beating Monlta for the place.
Caldwell let Corrigan's maiden Schrel
ber away first in the final event, and not
a policeman stopped him. Backed from
threes down .to 2. the crowd took the
"nunch" and rode the toboggan. Schrle
ber won galloping from Red Cherry, al
most as prognosticated In The Call.
Track Notes.
Johnny Campbell arrived a.t Oakland
track yesterday witn a string of horses
from Texaa. Jockey Al Shaw Is Â¦with the
stable.
It is ridiculous to presume that Yellow
tail. Advance Guard and P. W. Brode will
meet again. The first time this trio met
it was for blood, and a race iike it will not
be witnessed again for many a day. But
â¢when Yellowtail won It was different.
Fred Foster apparently Imagines that
his like has never been seen here before.
Alec Shields that everybody is not so
smart as the Canadians, and "Oora Paul"
Kruger that he. together with Charley
Ellison and Tommy Burns, are the- whole
thing. It is a well known fact that
Schorr did not care to start F. W. Brode
in the second meeting: of these three
year-olds. Why should he be desirous of
another meeting? At one and a sixteenth
miles Advance Guard -would be a "cinch."
Yellowtail kept the wires hot and Call
fornians stood for Sharkey and Fltzsim
mons fight, but the peach crop Is some
years a failure.

welts on the stomach showed he had been
struck. He stated 'that the blows - re
ceived in the kidneys brought on his de
feat. â¢* - - Â¦ Â¦ - -
Jackson's lips were puffed double their
usual size, and other marks on hia lace
attested that O'Brien's gloves had - re
peatedly landed. The colored boxer said:
"OBrien is more graceful but not as
clever as Tommy Tracey. O'Brien did not
stagger me during- the contest. He has
a wicked right, but that did not keep me
from playing for his stomach, which
eventually won me the battle. I fought
all through to win. and did bo. O'Brien
stuck his finger in my eye in the first
round, and that was the only pain I felt
throughout the entire fight."
Johnson, the colored plunger, wagered
J4W against $1250 in a three-man combina
tion. He picked Broad, Gans and Jack
son and won his bet, although Jackson
seemed an outside chance.
Before "Jimmy" Reilly could rub the
cobwebs out of his vision "Doc" Flynn
dealt him a number of heavy blows on
the Jaw and he went to the floor a beaten
man. It was in the latter part of the
first round that Flynn landed a right
cross on Reilly's jaw, and as the latter
ttagjrered his opponent planted another
on the vulnerable spot and Reilly went
down. He arose/ but Â¦was again sent to
the floor and stayed down until eight sec
onds Â¦were counted on him. He stag-gered
to his feet and Flynn feinted a number of
times and then sent a left swing, which
struck the mark and Reilly's aspirations
were crushed. Reilly's showing was a
disappointment to the spectators, as he
had done much better in the past.
The second bout brought out Jack Mc-
Mahon and Toby Irwin. The latter
knocked McMahon through the ropes
three times in the sixth round and won a
hard earned victory. The fight between
the two was highly interesting and full of
excitement. In the fifth round both lads
went at it "hammer and tongs," . and as
the round closed McMahon staggered Ir
win with a heavy rig-ht on the jaw. In
the sixth Irwin went after his man, and
every time he knocked McMahon through
the ropes the men at the ringside tossed
the battered bexer back.

SPORTS SAY
THE FIGHT
WAS FIXED
Â¦
Strong Evidence That O'Brien
Was Bribed to "Lay
Down," ;
SPECTATORS JEER SCENE.
Countless rumors have It that last
night's contest was a fake. After O'Brien
had received his quietus at 'the hands of
his ducky opponent sporting men were
loud in their cries of fake, and many of
the latter class unqualifiedly state that
they knew before the gong sounded for
the opening round that the fistic argument
would close In the thirteenth round and
those "in on the deal." having money on
the second line in the poolrooms, would
reap a golden harvest, HPifli
A numter of stories were going the
rounds after the light last .night, and
every one of them was swallowed by the
followers of the ring without thÂ« prover
bial pram of salt.- One of the stories was
to the effect that "Plunger" Johnson, the
colored boy, who had won a email fortune
betting on winners In fistic events, offered
and paid over to "Jack" O'Brien a large
sum to "lay down." and that the Philadel
phia pugilist had carried out his contract
and earned the . money. Another story
was to the effect that "Billy" White, at
whose residence O'Brien made his home
during his stay in the city, had bet $500
on Jackson to win, he having knowledge
that his friend would opportunely lose.
The strongest Indication that a shade
of suspicion hung over the fight even be
fore the men stepped into the ring was
evidenced when J. C. Humphreys, the
well-known lacing man, drove out to
131&nk.ei)'s Six Mile house, where the
white pugilist was training, and informed
the latter that h*> had heard that he was
going to quit in the thirteenth round and
offered him $5iX) to go on and win: Mr.
Humphreys was seen early this morning
and stated that he clid make the trip
and with that end In view. He said:
"I heard the rumor that the O'Brien-
Jackson fight was fixed and that O'Brien
was to lose bo that the ."second liners"
would land their money. As ' I had bet
beavlly on the white man to win I drove
out to his training quarters yesterday and
told him that if he defeated Jackson I
would present him with $500. 1 saw him
again the same evening and repeated my
offer and he assured me that he would be
the victor. On his assurance 1 bet a fair
stun and lost. Where I got my informa
tion that the fight would be a fake I am
not at liberty to say."
Boxer O'Brien was informed of the ugly
rumors at an early hour and made strong
denial that he had been a party to any
euch schemes. He admitted that Mr.
Humphreys visited him at his training
quarters and stated that the horseman
offered him 5200 to go In and win and that
he doubled the offer when he met him in
town the same evening. O'Brien .said:
"Humphrey* told me In the afternoon
that rumor had it that I was going to
May down,* and he offered to make me a
present of J2OO if I would go in and win.
I told him I would accept his money, as
I was going to win. The same evening
he came to me and doubled the offer, and
eaid that if the referee gave me the deci
sion be would come to my dressing room
after the fipht and pay me $400. As to the
etory that Johnson gave me $1000 to allow
myself to be defeated, it is preposterous.
1 have never seen him nor have I had
any talk wilh any of his agents.
"I want to brand that yarn as a lie.
Mr. White, to my certain knowledge, bet
5300 on me .^to win, and I regret to say
that he has* lost Ills money. He has the
pool ticket 6 to prove my assertion. I
would never talk to him if I knew that he
would deliberately bet against me. I did
my best to win and thought I was win
ning hands down until I received a blow
that ruined my chances. The pain was so
gre-at that I did not know where I was
standing, and I did not know until I got
Into my d res singr- room what round I had
lost in. I have money of my own. and I
will do my utmost to get a return match,
and if I do not I will never don a glove
again. I am no faker and I hope to prove
It before I leave this town."
Jack O'Brien, the boxer, was defeated
by Toung Peter Jackson, the fighter. In
the thirteenth round of their bout last
nipht at Woodward's Pavilion. The con
tent was one of the most brilliant ex
hlbitions of its kind ever seen here, but,
unfortunately for O'Brien, it was corn-
ID' !1 gossip on the streets that the fight
had been fixed and that he was to lose.
The betting had a bad look, especially in
parts mutuele. The greatest number of
tickets were sold on the line which won,
an unusual coincidence. It was par
tlcularly so in this case, as on form
O'Brien should have easily lasted the al
lot ted twenty rounds and should have
The end came suddenly In the thir
teenth round. Up to that time O'Brien
etemed a veritable will-o'-the-wisp. He
Â»'aÂ« in every corner of the ring except
the one in which Jackson thought he had
him at his mercy. He was the finished
boxer, with every an and artifice ol the
game developed to its highest point. The
tpectators laughed at and cheered the
Strenuous but futile efforts of the col
ored man to land an efTecUve blow.
O'Brien all this time was landing at will
on his sturdy opponent. His blows
mlÂ£ht just as well be showered on a
punching bag for all the effect they had
on Jackson.
When the rival boxers . went to work
in the thirteenth round Jackson was still
lull of light. He could not g-et away from
two rights which O'Brien landed on his
etotnach. O'Urien led for the head, and
eÂ» he stepped, away Jackson caught him
a glancing risrht on the chin. The blow
must have imn more severe than It
reexned. as the Philadelphian half stag
gered to the roj>Â«6 on the western Bi<le of
ihe ring. Jackson, quick to see his ad
vantage, rushed at O'Brien and landed
fclow After blow on the latter's body
O'Urfen clinched to avoid punishment and
was dragged or pushed all over the ring.
Jackson waÂ« sending In trip-hammer
Wows on his adversary's body, uslntf
right and left indiscriminately whenever
he could get within striking distance.
O"Brien tried desperately to last until
the ben could cave him, but his opponent
finally sent him down on his hands and
knees. He groped blindly In an "ffcrt

eeconds were counted off before he ":o*Jl<l

MUSTY RECORD SPEAKS FROM GARRET
Signature of 'Â«James G. Fair and Wife* Found in Old
Register o! a Sausalito Hotel.
The discovery on the 1592 register of the old Hotel El Monte at Sausalito
of the signature, "James G. Fair and wife," may prove a bomD in the camp
of Fairs heirs. The discovery was made by Dan Slinkey, the poundmaster,
brother of John A. Slinkey. the late proprietor of the hotel, and two others
whom Slinkey says he took with him for the sake of precaution.
Yesterday Slinkey read the account of Mrs. Craven's testimony as to the
marriage performed in Sausalito by Judge Simpton. Ills interest was aroused
and he racked his memory In the effort to recall any circumstances con
nected with the couple's visit to the town. Then it flashed across his mind
that in July. ISS2, two guests sojourned at his brother's hotel for two days.
Thf^Ff truopts were called by the townspeople who knew them by sight Mr.
and Mrs. Fair.
When John Slinkey left the town he gave his old registers Into his
brother's keeping. They had lain in Dan Slinkey's garret since 1594 and had
grown moldy when his curiosity Impelled' him to drag: them Into light and
search their pages for the signature he thought should be there.
As Slinkey had anticipated, half way down the page and about the middle
ot the 1532 reg-ister appeared the Senator's signature, followed by, the words,
and wife." The date is=. Slinkey says. July 23.
Ellnkey evidently is sincere In his declaration, despite the fact that he
refuses to show the register. He says that he will 'take an oath before a
notary that his statement is correct and will show the register itself "when
the time comes." He apparently is divided between fears of being dragged
Into the case as a witness and pride In telling cf his discovery. He refuses
to divulge the names of the two witnesses who saw the signature with him,
but says they are merchants of Sausalito.
"I will tell all when the time comes," he said. "I do not wish to get Into
trouble by talking too much;"

Simpton was elected Justice of the

yÂ«>ars. It was during his third term, ac
cording to hi? own statement, that he

Assailants of Barling

ARE THUGS AND ASSASSINS
THIS IS THE CHARGE MADE
BY JUDGE DENSON.,
Opposing Counsel Make Answer and
Judg-e Troutt leaves the Ac
cused to the Mercy of the
Criminal Court.
Â¦ .-*
A CLOUDâ the blackest in the his
tory of local jurisprudenceâ has
cast its shadow over the litigation
by which Mrs. Nettie R. Craven
seeks to establish her claim that
she is the widow of the late James G.
Fair, and all because the representatives
of one of the dead millionaire's heirs In
sist on strengthening their liner of defense
with thugs and assassins. This was the
plain, unvarnished statement made by
Judge Denson yesterday morning when
Judge Troutt again called for hearing the
matter of the application of Mrs. Nettle
R. Craven for a family allowance from
the estate of the late James G. Fair. The
charge of counsel was taken up by the
representatives of the various defendants
and a battle of bitter words waged until
the court ordered a suspension of hostiti
ties until this morning.
The assault by two private detectives
upon Capitalist H. J. Barling, who occu
pied a seat, before injury, among Mrs.
Craven's friends, was the cause of the
war among the lawyers. When the case
was called Judge Denson asked the privi
lege to address the court. Judge Denson
first called the attention of the court to
his long experience before the 'bar and
referred to many distinguished practition
ers with whom he had associated and
against whom he had pressed claims of
his many clients, this to prove hia knowl
edge of the facts about which he was. to
speak. Judge Denson then laid the facts
of the assault upon Mr. Barling before tho
court. He said as above quoted that the
cloud cast upon the case by reason of the
cowardly assault was the blackest In the
history of local jurisprudence. It was the
act of thugs and assassins, he continued,
and if his theory was right he believed
that his client, her friends, her witnesses
and her counsel were entitled to the pro
tection of the court. "The very men that
assailed Mr. Barling yesterday are now
at large and in all probability are shadow
ing other witnesses and scheming to com
mit other crimes."
Judge Troutt said that as the assault
upon Mr. Barling occurred without the
jurisdiction of the court, having occurred
during a. recess ' and In the corridor of
the hall, he was powerless to take action
against the offenders. It remained with
the criminal courts, he said, to pass Judg
ment upon the accused.
It looked for a minute as though the
discussion was ended, but George A.
Knight, who represents Charles L. Fair,
had taken the statement made by Judge
"Denson as referring to his cjlent, and he
raised his voice in angry protest. "I will
not have it Insinuated by opposing coun
sel that my client was responsible for
the attack upon Mr. Barling," he said.
"No one connected with this case Insti
gated the attack upon him, and it is very
probable that his own actions were re
sponsible. His Insolent manner has given
offense for days past, and It was con
cluded some days ago that he felt se
cure in the protection of a 45-callber re
volver he is known to keep on his per
son If Mr. Fair has employed detec
tives, which he has not. it was to guard
against threats made by Barling himself.
These threats had been reported to us
and we have paid for them. In no other
way can we meet the claims of this wo
man, which we know to be based on fraud
and perjury."
Judge Troutt failed to see sufficient rea
son for Mr. Knight's Â»arcastic address
and he successfully reasoned with him
and quiet against reigned, but only for
a brief period. Garret McEnerney, who
represents the executors, concluded to en
ter the controversy. Addressing the court,
he said that he would admit that the
executors had employed detectives and
would continue to do so in the effort to.
successfully cope with Mrs. Craven, her
friends and counsel. "We are confident
that we can prove that. Mrs. Craven's
claims are false, forged- and perjured,
he said, "and we have employed Curtin s
Detective Agency to assist us. We know
nothing about the assault upon Barling
and all regret that it occurred."
Lafe Pence, who is associated with
Judge Denson, took advantage of Mr. Mc-
Enerney's remarks and demanded that
the court forthwith order the disband
ment of the detective squad. "Mrs. Cra
ven, her friends, her counsel and her
rights are In danger," he said, "if these
men are permitted to hound our foot
steps " Judge Troutt again said that he
could do nothing with the detectives un
less something specific was proved against
them, as they were not guilty of any of
fense so far as his knowledge was con
cerned "Well." came from the Fair side
of the house, "counsel opposing us should
remember that although they suffer some
inconvenience ours has been greater than
theirs Just a day ago we asked the lib
erty of examining a document and the
privilege was accorded us. During the
examination of the document we were an
noyed by the leering of a representative
of the other side and our every move is
leered upon over our shoulders by some
irresponsible but authorized seeker of in
formation." 4 'Â¦â¢'Â¦
An answer was revolving Itself
in the minds of Mrs. Craven's
counsel and one cf them arose
to make known his thoughts when
Judge Troutt ordered the hearing to pro
ceed Pence, however, said that the
shock of the battle in which Barling was
injured had so affected his client's nerves

Although Judge Troutt advanced the
theory that the assault upon Mr. Barling
had occurred outside the jurisdiction of
the court the matter will be formally
placed before him by affidavit, and by
this means young Curtin. who was ar
rested and charged with the offense, may
vet be punished for contempt of court.
Last evening Barling made an affidavit.
After setting forth the facts of the as
sault Barling charges Curtin with being a
hired fighter, and says that he was once
employed by the Pacific Steam Whaling
Company and sent to Alaska for the pur
pose of rendering hors de combat any one
who attempted to erect any buildings on
property on Knrluk Beach, Alaska, which
was. in fact, the property of the Alaska
Packers* Association. All through his af
fidavit Mr. Barling clings to his assertion
thnt the attack upon him was made after
a deliberate plan had been effected, con
federates being present to even hold the
doors leading out of the City Hall ro

BAD NEWS
FOR CALIFORNIA
GRAPE GROWERS
Zante Currants to Be
Admitted Free.
The effect of Judge Morrow's decision in
the United States Circuit Court on March
18, 1896, in re Wise, otherwise known as
the Zante currant case, has been upset by
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals for the . Second Circuit, in which
New York City is located.
â¢ Judge Morrow decided that Zante cur
rants are not currants, but seedless
grapes, and that the name was one by
which the dried variety grown In the
island of Zante or elsewhere was known
to commerce. It was shown at the trial
here that no dried currants had been pro
duced on the island of Zante for some
years, but that the. bulk of Zante cur
rants were produced on islands near by.
Hence, under the tariff act of August 2S
1894, it was decided that they were duti
able at l\b cents per pound. The decision
gave Kreat satisfaction to California grape
growers interested in the culture of Seed
less Sultana and Thompson's Seedless v.i
rlety of California raisins, which are su
perior in size, cleanliness ' and flavor to
the so-called Zante currant.
The Circuit Court of Appeals in NÂ»w
York has decided that as the currants in
the case appealed by the Hills Brothers
Company were the product of the Islands
adjacent to that of Zante and known as
Amalias and Provincials- they were other
than Zante currants and therefore ad
missible, free of duty.

Attorney Lafe Pence states that the op
ponents of his client became aware two
weeks ago that the person who officiated
at the marriage of Mrs. Craven and Sen
ator Fair was golnj? to be produced in
court, and since then have been movlnc
heaven and earth in the attempt to dis
cover his identity. According to Attorney
Pence hired detectives have been shad
owing the movements of everybody, con
nected with his side of the celebrated
case.
"It cost them just about $80,000. exclu
sive of attorney's fees, for the services
of stenographers, detectives, handwrit
ing experts and photographers when the
deed case was tried." he said, "and the
executors of the estate are likely to du
plicate that amount In the present litiga
tion. A lump sum of SSOOO was paid to
Curtin's Detective -Agency at one time.
"As regards the existence of hotel reg

or that we now have them in our pos

Ing the m. stake of a detective who had
been "shadowing" the lawyer for a week
and finally discovered something that
caused him to make a report to head
quarters. A day later he discovered some
thing else, something that so catered to
his own idea of the humorous that the de
tective himself related his mistake to the
author of the tale and laughed heartily
at his own blunder. v -
"It seems t*-at after he had kept a
close 'tab' on Mr. Pence's movements for
a week," said the informant, "the detect

with a lady and "take a car. He followed
the two and later handed in a report that

ed a car and when they left it went into
a house on the corner of Shrader anl

next day he discovered that the- 'hand

Is an ardent friend of Pe-ru-na. having
used It many years.
In speaking of his good health and ex-
treme old age. Mr. Brock says:
"After a man has lived in, the world as
long as I have he ought to have found
out a great many things by experience. I
think I have done so.
"One of the things I have found
out to my entire satisfaction is
the proper remedy for ailments
that are due directly to the ef-
fects of the climate. For 111
years I have withstood the change-
able climate of the United States.
"I have always been a very healthy
man. but of course subject to the little
affections which are due to sudden
changes In the climate and temperature.
During my long life I have known a
great many remedies for coughs, colds,
catarrh and diarrhoea.
"I had always supposed these affections
to be different diseases. For the last ten
or fifteen years I have been reading Dr.
Hartman's writings. I have learned much
from his books, one thing In particularâ
that these affections are the same and
that they are properly called catarrh.
â¢'As for Dr. Hartman's remedy,
Pe-ru-na, I have found It to bs the
best. If not the only, reliable rem-
edy tor these affections. It has
been my standby for many years,
and I attribute my good health and
extreme old aga to this remedy.
"It exactly meets all my requirements.
It protects me from the evil effects of
sudden changes: It keeps me in good apÂ«
petite; It gives me strength; It keeps my
blood In good circulation. I have come to
rely upon It almost entirely for the many
little things for which I need medicine.
*'I believe it to be. valuable to old people,
although I have no doubt it is Just aa good
for the young. I should be glad If my
sincere testimony should become tho
means of others using this remedy. bÂ«-
cause I believe It to be the greatest rem-
edy of this age for catarrhal diseases.
"When epidemics of la *rippe first began
to make their appearance in this country
I was a sufferer from this disease.
"I had several long sieges with
the grippe. At first I did not know
that Pe-ru-na was a remedy for
this disease. When I heard that
la grippe was epidemic catarrh I
tried Pe-ru-na for la grippe and
found It to be just the thing.
"It has saved me several times from
a siege of the grippe. I feel perfectly
safe from this terrible malady so long aa
I have Pe-ru-na at hand. I hope that Dr.
Hartman may live to be as old ajÂ» I am.
to continue the good -work of teaching the
people the value of his great remedy, Pe-

WHY GREAT BRITAIN CANNOT WIN.
Original Views of an Influential Boer Who Has
Studied the Transvaal Situation.
p-p^HERE Is a strong suspicion that the defection of the Cape Afrikanders to the
I forces of the- two republics Is much more general than the censored news
I received In Europe would lead one to suppose. Mlddleburg, Paarl. Vlc-
J. torla West. AVorcester, Wellington, Malmesbury have not yet been Invaded
by the Boers, but the population is in a state of ferment, as the Enslish cor
respondents Inform their papers. Members of some of the best families have
Joined the Boers. The son of Mr. Theron, member of the Cape Parliament, wired
to his father: "Farewell! I'm off to the front." Theron sent the message to
Sir Alfred Milner with the short remark: "This is my only son!"
We summarize the following from the Gotha Petermann's Mittheilungen, as to
the relative strength of the Dutch and Anglo-Saxon elements:
The official British statistics furnish no clew as regards the number of
Dutch, but the church registers of the three great Dutch churches do. TJey
have a registered membership of 350,000. All these may be reckoned as sympathiz
ers with the Boers. Dutch Afrikanders of the towns and mines who have been
Anglicized are not Included in this estimate. But even with these, the English
element number hardly 140,000. exclusive of the troops as there are lOOuo to
20,000 of other nationalities. Of the white population in the republics. 250.000 are
Hoers, 60.000 British and 40.000 other "UiUanders." Throughout all South Africa
there are 6-15,000 Boers, 245,000 British and 9*3.000 other whites.

It is claimed that illiteracy Is less common among the Boers of Cape Col
ony than in England, and that although the wealthy Boers prefer on the whole
to lead the life of country gentlemen, the percentage of highly educated men iÂ»
greater among them than among the same class in England The ideas that this
class entertain concerning England are probably fairly well represented In the
following communication addressed by an Afrikander, then resident In London, to
the London Times several weeks ago:
We are not as ignorant as British statesmen and newspaper writers, nor are
we such fools as you British are. We wanted delay, we got it, and are now prac
tically masters. We know facts, Buch as the following:
I. The powers do not Intend you to get possession of the Transvaal gold. After
encouraging you to believe that they will not interfere, they will assist us direct
ly or indirectly to drive you out of Africa. 1-iZ'l,

there will be rebellion, for patriotism does not exist among your working classes.

WAYS THAT ARE DARK
SHOULD the Supervisors carry out the recom
mendation of the Finance Committee, this city
will for some time to come be literally a com
munity of "ways that are dark." The recommenda
tion is that from March 1 to July 1 the. street lamps
shall be unlighted. That means that during the four
months of March, April, May and June the city is to
have no lights except such as shine through the win
dows of shops and barrooms. At least two of these
months are within the rainy season, when the nights
are apt to be clouded and Â»yen the starlight obscured.
Thus for many nights we are to have the blackness of
Egyptian gloom, and a carnival time for all the
criminal classes that prowl in the dark.
The excuse for this outrage upon the community
is that of economy and reform. The people put trust
in the loud vauntings of the reformers at the last elec
tion, and now they receive the reward which never
fails those who are credulous enough to believe the
professions of that class of politicians. It was in a
condition of mental darkness that the suffrages of the
people were given" to' the reformers, and it is in four
months of physical darkness they will have to repent
their folly.
It is now conceded by the reformers themselves that
it will cost more money to conduct the municipal
government under the new charter than under the
consolidation act. They are ready to make that.con
cession, for they arc now in office and have no fur
ther use for misrepresentation and buncombe. m More
money is needed and more money will have to be
forthcoming, and until it is forthcoming the city is to
be in darkness and. the people are to stay at home at
night, carry lanterns, or take their chances with
thieves, thugs and hoodlums in the gloom.
Some of the reformers have grown weary of the
consequences of their folly and have begun to devise
ways and means for avoiding them. Assessor Dodge
is one of that class. He recently concocted a scheme
to raise the assessment of property in San Francisco
to the extent of $100,000,000, and requested the State
Board of Equalization to connive at the fraud with
out taking advantage of it. His request was that the
State Board should cut down the assessment he pro
poses to make by $100,000,006, so as to prevent San
Francisco property from being taxed to that amount
for State purposes, while the tax was collected for
municipal purposes.
It is to such a condition we. have been brought by
the Phelan reformers. The Assessor is to put us up
to tricks that are vain, and the Supervisors are to
reduce us to ways that are dark. In the nights of
gloom when the taxpayer wends his way home
through the unlighted streets he will have ample op
portunity to meditate upon the ways of political re
formers in general and the Phelanites in particular,
and if he escape the dangers of the dark he will know
how to vote when the next municipal election takes
For the present there appears no remedy for the
evil. At the very threshold of the new era, at the
very time when the expanding commerce of the Pa
cific Ocean is likely to attract most attention to San
Francisco, we are to exhibit ourselves as a. back
number town â as the only city of its size in the
civilized world without street lighting at night.
TO AMEND THE CARTER.
BY the subtle skill of Attorney Pillsbury the new
charter was dra-.vn up in such a way as to de
prive the municipal government of authority to
supervise and regulate telephone companies. Flushed
with gratification at the success of the trick and san
guine oi their power to defy the people, the telephone
companies have announced a determination not only
to maintain their present exorbitant rates and old
abuses, but to shirk their taxes by shifting them upon"
the patrons of the line. "We sha'l put the taxes in
the bill," said the secretary of the company, "and
then we shall sec some lively kicking."
Jt is one of the good things of this world that the
law of compensation works out redress for almost all
evils. "He that roars for liberty faster binds the
tyrant's power, and the tyrant's cruel glee forces on
the freer hour." The ululation of the telephone men
over their "cinch" upon the public has aroused popu
lar indignation, and there is a bright prospect ahead
of 5 redress that will be drastic and lasting.
The people have two avenues of redress against the
exactions and the tax-shirking of the telephone com
pany. By one they can appeal to the Legislature.
By the other the\- can take the matter in their own
hands and amend the charter so as to restore to the
municipality in rightful power to supervise all cor
porations operating under municipal franchises and
controlling public utilities. The first avenue can be
resorted to only when the Legislature meets next
winter. In the meantime, therefore, it will be worth
Â¦ bile to make use of the second.
The charter provides that whenever 15 per cent of
the voters at the previous municipal or State election
<hall petition the Supervisors to call an election for
the purpose of amending the charter, it shall be the
duty of the Supervisors to do so. and to make all pro
visions for it. Under that clause it is in the power
of the people to restore to the municipality the power
of which it was cheated by the cleverness of the tele
phone attorney.
Since the telephone company appears determined
neither to pnt a Â«top to its exactions nor to pay its
tu\es. it will be well for the people to take steps at
once to call for an election for such an amendment.
The issue is one of the highest importance, because if
tl:e telephone company be permitted to shift it? taxes
o;>on the public, other corporations will follow the
evil example. The attention of public-spirited citi
zens should be given to the issue at once. As it stands
the charter is gravely defective in exempting one cor
poration from a rule that applies to all others, and
the defect should be remedied without delay.
cans of Congress a blunder in party politics as well as
in statecraft. In 1896 the Republicans pledged them
selves to re-enact a protective tariff, maintain the gold
standard and provide for American shipping. Two
of those pledges have been fulfilled. The gold stan
dard has been firmly upheld, a comprehensive protec
tive tariff is in force, and, despite the efforts of Ka.<
son to weaken it by one-sided reciprocity, treaties,
will continue in force. There" remains the shipping
industry of the country to be provided for, and that
duty should be attended to before the Presidential
campaign opens.
In a broader view of the case, it will be unfortunate
for every industry of the nation if the shipping bill be
not passed, for at this juncture in our affairs the wel
fare of all is dependent upon the expansion of our
commerce and the transportation of our surplus
products to foreign markets. The protective tariff it
self will be hardly more beneficial to the country than
this measure, vhich is designed- to supplement it by
giving protection to our industries on sea as well as
on land.
The opposition is powerful. The subsidized steam
ship companies of the Old World dread the menace
of American competition, and they rind not a few allies
in our own country to co-operate with them in their
efforts to prevent such competition. Added to their
strength is all that of the inveterate free traders, who
oppose anything in the way of governmental aid to
industry. It is a formidable force to overcome, but
the strength that supports the bill is strong enough to
master it. Republicans who are resolute in the con
test will find the people. with them on election day.

ThE SHIPPING BILL.
f* OCCIDENT with the report from Washing
[â¢ ton that the shipping bill may not be taken up
at this session of Congress comes the announce â¢
ment that the trans-Atlantic mail service is seriously
affected by a lack of steamships to carry it. The Brit
ish have withdrawn a good many Atlantic steamers
for the transportation of troops to South Africa, and
the United States has none to take their place.
Commenting upon the situation the Boston Trans
cript said on February 1: "The taking off of the
Etruria for transport service has led to various irregu
larities iti our foreign mails. The Pennsylvania has
been held to take her mails from this side, and the
Germanic has suffered a similar fate in taking the
mails of the Umbria." To that statement of fact is
added: "Postal authorities are agreed in the opinion
that an American line of mail steamers given a
proper subsidy would bring about an improvement at
once in mail service, not only by the actual carrying
of mails from this country on Wednesdays and Sat
urdays of each week, but by stimulating the British
lines to activity and toning up the foreign service.
At present the mails for this country from England
are taken at Liverpool, although the last land touched
is at Queenstown. Were the foreign mails carried
by the American line, for instance, they might be
taken on at Southampton, some nineteen hours later,
r.rTording another business day's mail an opportunity
to be fonvarded quickly to this country. From the
point of view of the postal service, nnd of course this
is more or less the point ofr.view of every business
house with foreign correspondents, an American mail
subsidy would prove of immense value."
That is but one of the many evidences the time
affords of the urgency of the upbuilding of
our merchant marine. It is an important
phase of the issue, ' but by no means- the most
important, for we need a merchant marine to
carry our commerce as, well as to carry the mail. It
is, however, a pertinent. subject for consideration,
since it has happened just at" trie time when Congress
is apparently hesitating to enact the shipping bill the
country demands.

AIR AS A LUBRICATOR.
ACCORDING to one of our Scotch exchanges
there has been recently tested on the Tay an
invention which promises to be of even more
advantage to ocean transportation than the famous
Turbina, of which so much was heard a year or so
ago. The latter invention is one of mechanism, and
can be made use of in a steamship only by displacing
a considerable part of the machinery now employed.
The new one can be used in any kind of a steamship
and with any kind of machinery, since it consists
solely in providing a lubricator, which will permit the
ship to pass through the water with little or no fric
tion.
It is well known that when a steamer is propelled
through the water she meets with a degree of resist
ance that varies with her speed. As the inventor, R.
S. Baxter, is quoted as putting it: "It is a case of
one body being forced to slide upon another without
the intervention of a suitable third body between them
?o act as lubricator." It is said the only substance
that can be profitably used between the ship and the
tea as a lubricant is air, and the inventor claims to
have devised a ireans by which its use is made prac
ticable.
The "aspirator." as the machine is called which
supplies the air, is described as being self-acting and
Without any moving part*. It is a V-shaped air
channel, which passes down the vessel's stem as far
as the keel, and in most cases goes a certain distance
along the keel. Tins channel may be cither inside
cr outside the vessel, and is provided with certain
protected openings or ports constructed in such a
v.':v that the water rushing past them produces a
minus pressure within them, and consequently draws
oft a continuous stream of air, which, passing along
the subu:crged surface of the ship, cuts off the im
!Â¦Â¦Â¦ diate contact with the water, and therefore the
w.ter friction.
It is the claim of the inventor that by means of
his proces- a rtcamer make*; her voyage in a con
tii.'jous air jacket. The air of course ultimately rises
to the surface of the water, but if the ship be goin^
r't a fair degree of speed Â«he will pass her whole
!r:-glh through the air current before it escapes. It
i> >aid that in the experiments made with steamships
CJi the Tay there was an increase of speed amounting
to from 2\ to 26 per cent of the ordinary speed of th*
fhip, and it v.-as noted that the greater percentage of
increase was in ships that had the greater speed. to
The lets made in the Tay can hardly be taken as
sr.^cient demonstration of the usefulness of the in
v<:ition. It appear?, however, to be one that can be
cVsily tried and without great cost on ocean steam
er?. If the claims of the inventor, therefore, be Well
founded it will not be long before the air-jacket will
be used on nlmost every steamship that crosses the
!fi. We fhail then have not only air-brakes on our
j^ilroads lv-it air lubricants on our ships, and per
haps, rrc ionfr. condensed air or liquid air to run the
mechanism of both.

THE SAN FBAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1900.
THE POLICE COMMISSION.
,\ A .AYOR PHELAN has been baffled in his ef
/ V fort to turn the. Police Department over tc
* * Andrew M. Lawrence and the'gamblers, but
he has found under the charter a means of revenging
himself upon the man who baffled him, and William
J. Biggy has been dismissed from the Police Com
mission. For the present the issue rests with the re
organization of the commission by the -appointments
of William T. Wallace and D. I. Mahoney, and the
election of William P. Sullivan Jr. to the position of
Chief of Police. .With the new order of things the
public will be fairiy weil satisfied. The new Commis
sioners and the new Chief will be given the confidence
of the people to start with, and they will not lose it
unless they betray it.
Out of the controversy Mr. Biggy emerges with
'-honor. Long ago the Examiner said of him:. "He is
[ the sort of man who could make himself felt whether
ihe stood with eleven or alone. If he were in a minor
' ity he would meet every corrupt scheme with an op
! position so vigorous, persistent and' disturbing that
: he would attract the attention of the whole com-
I niunity." As a Police Commissioner Mr. Biggy ful-
I filled the literal and plain meaning of those words,
' bm the false journal that published them is now re
i riling him because he did not give the lie to its com-
I mendation.
â¢ Before the subject is dismissed from public con
sideration it is well that "due attention be given to
certain features of it which arc of permanent interest
because of the light they tlirow upon the character of
the principal persons involved. In the first place, let
Mayor Phelan.be judged by the evidence of his own
statements/ made not in the carelessness of private
conversation, but in the deliberatcness of public docu
ments.
In his communication to the Board of Supervisors
setting forth his reasons for removing Commissioner
Piggy the Mayor refers to the cause which led to his
appointment, and says: "In appointing the Police
Commission I had it at first composed of Messrs.
Thomas, McNutt, .Newhall and David I. Mahoney,
subsequently named as a member of the Board of
Fire Commissioners. The day before the appoint
ments were announced Mr. Biggy made a personal
application and appeal to me for this place, to which
I yielded."
Contrast that statement of the Mayor with tin's,
which he made in an open letter to the Examiner,
published January 17: "I think the character of my
appointees is a sufficient guarantee to the public of
the sincerity of my intentions. I had canvassed their
names in common with others and found them free
from entangling alliances. William Thomas was at
the head of his profession. Dr. W. F. McXutt stood
in the same relation to his profession. W. J. Biggy
had an irreproachable public record, and George A.
Xewhall was a leader among merchants of the city."
Such are two of the statements of the Mayor con
cerning the appointment. In the one he asserts he
had thoroughly canvassed Mr. Biggy's fitness for the
cilice and found him a man. of irreproachable public
record. In the other he "asserts he had not consid
ered Biggy at all, but at the last moment gave tt\e
ofHce at Biggy's personal solicitation.
Both of these statements cannot be true, for the
truth is ever consistent with itself: but both can be
false, for falsehoods are not bound by consistency.
Both of them are false. The truth is given by Mr.
Biggy himself in the announcement that he was given
the appointment to the commission not by Phelan,
but by Lawrence, to whom the Mayor had given the
four Police Commissionerships to be filled by Law
rence's friends.
With that evidence now fairly before the public the
statements of The Call concerning Phelan's ante
election pledges have been proven beyond further
gainsaying. The reformers, moreover, have now a
full revelation of the character of Phclan and of the
kind of men to whom he was and is willing to intrust
the police affairs of the community. In the exppsure
of this shameful agreement and conspiracy we have no
desire to linger. It may be that in politics as in other
matters "all is well that ends well," and in some re
spects this fight has ended to the satisfaction of the
public. The Lawrence bargain has been defeated and
the scheme of the gamblers baffled. For that good
result the public is indebted to*\Villiam J. Biggy. who
retires from office with an unstained honor and the
satisfaction of having saved the city from disgrace
and the people from the corruptions of a wide-open

The Board of Education at Its meeting
yesterday persevered in Its announce!
policy of reducing classes in the public
schools, and as a result five schools will
have one teacher less in the future on the
ground that the average daily attendance
does not warrant the employment of so
many pedagogues as are now In t^e de

fhe consolidation state that the efficiency
of the School Department will not in any
way be Impaired by decreasing the num
ber of teachers.
Superintendent AVebstcr has publicly
expressed hlmstif against the consolida
tion of classes and takes the opposite
stand on the question of the efficiency bÂ»
ing Impaired, but consolidation neverthe
less goes merrily on and will go on until
at least fifty teachers find themselves
without positions.' The following consoli

we have no knowledge, and. In fact. It
probably il!d not exist.
The Egyptians seemed chiefly to have
worshiped the sun. and the highest sods
were but names of that luminary. Ihey
were passing through the stage of what
Max Muller has caJled henothelsm. which
is not exactly monotheism, but the habit
of addressing and worshiping now one
god and now another as if he were su
preme, especially the sun-god, as there
are hymns that sound like the psalms to
Jehovah. But beyond this henotheistio
state of mind there comes to light at
times a notion of the deity quite apart
from these nature-gods. Read, for In
stance, these lines from a well-known
hymn:
God Is OnÂ» and Alone, and th*re is nonÂ« other
with him.
God is a Spirit, a hldvlen Spirit, the Spirit of
Spirits.
God is ihe Truth He livÂ»s by Truth. He llveÂ»
upon Truth. He is the Klr.g cf Truth.
God is conii>a?*ir>nate to those that fear Him
and hears those who cry unto Him.
For us the religious literature of Egypt
has three points of interest. First, be
cause many of the customs ami rites of the
Jews as related in the Old Tesrament
were probably due to Egyptian influence,
as. for example, the tustom of holding
swine's flesh as unclean. Secondly, be
cause we may take encouragement to our
selve3 in reading the moral precepts of
this ancient people, and in finding that as
far back as time goes morality is still
the same and always a measure of civili
zation. Sometimes these precepts were
quite separated from religion. -*nd In gen
eral we may say that the Egyptians were
more advar.ced in their moral than in
their religious ideaa. Other* of their max
ims breathe a true spirituality, as, for ex
ample, this:
To ob*y ir to love God. but to dieobey la to
hate Him.
And thirdly we may find Interest In th!s
religion because, as Herodotus says. "The
Egyptian* were the first to maintain that
thf soul of man is immortal." In a cer
tain sense this statement Is true, although
it is not to be supposed that the other peo
ples of the world borrowed the doctrine
of immortality from the dwellers on the
Nile.
The Egyptian notions concerning the fu
ture are the result of a conglomeration
of various views, and are so confused thac
it is impossible to give any clear account
of them. Everybody know 3 how -careful
the people were in hewing or building
tombs â the pyramids stand as witness to
this â and in embalming the dead. '"These
tombs," Diodorus informs us. "they
called eternal habitations, and spared no
magnificence in their construction; but
they called the houses of the living Inn 3.
to be inhabited only for a little while, and
took small care to adorn them." We do
not quite understand why the Egyptians
were so careful in building their tombs
and in preserving the dead. They Â«em
to have had some notion of the resurrec
tion of the body. They also believed in a
sort of double of the man. called hla KA,
Â¦which hovered near his dead body and re
ceived nourishment from the KA of the
food which was offered up by the man's
relatives in the tomb. All this while the
actual soul of the man was supposed to be
going a journey down a mysterious river
that flowed through the region of death,
as the Nile flowed through Egypt. On the
way he had to encounter a!l sorts of devils
and monsters who attempted to seize him.
and to escape these It was necessary to
repeat certain masie formulae. These
formulae were collected In the so-called
"Book of the Dead." a copy of which was.
commonly buried with the corpse to re
fresh his memory during the Journey, and
which, though of little philosophic or In
trinsic Interest, is much the best known
work of Esryptian literature. At the end
of the Journey the soul entered the great

Petition to Open Public Streets.
The Board of Public "Works yesterday
referred a petition from residents, of the
Fairmount tract, west of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, to City Engineer
Grunsky for investigation. The petition
contained a request that St. Mary's ave
nue be opened across the railroad tracks
and througrh private property, the depth
of one lot. to Arlington street. The City
Engineer said .the extension desired
would be dangerbus, and suggested that
an overhead crossing a block to the
north be constructed.
The board denied " the request of Mau
rice Casey to build an additional story
on the building at 130 Ellis street, on the
ground that it would conflict with the fire
ordinances.
The Holly Park . and Mission Street
Improvement Club petitioned the board
to open Richmond avenue and East Park
street to Andover street, thereby making
it possible to have the streets graded and
sewered. The City Engineer was in

CITY'S ASSESSMENT ROLL.
Board of Equalization Inspects PreÂ«
liminary Work.
Two members of the State Board of
Equalizationâ T. O. Toland and Alex
Brownâ accompanied by State Controller
Colgan and Secretary C. 11. Coglan. yes
terday paid an Informal visit to Assessor
Dodge for the purpose of Â¦ ascertaining
what progress had been made in the pre
liminary work of making up the city's
assessment roll. The members of the
board inspected the- books and expressed
themselves as satisfied with the result.
An informal discussion was held regard
ing what the law contemplates In the
methods to be followed in assessing cor
porations, other than railroad.*, that own
property in various counties of the State
and whose place of incorporation iÂ» in
the city. There appears to be a differ
ence or opinion as to whether the city
or State has power to assess. No con
clusion was arrived at and the matter
was postponed for future consideration.
The assessment roll of the city and coun
ty ' was not mentioned in the discussion
though Assessor Dodge took occasion to
deny that he had ever appealed to any
member of the board with the object of
raising the assessed valuation of this dty
5100.C00.000. Dodge stated that he had no
preconceived Ideas as to what the as
sessment roll would amount to.

of the Greek gave the first real Impulse
to the study. But it remained for an
other Frenchman, Champollion. to fnd
the key to these strange figns. He Ik~
gan his study of the language in ISIS, a-.d
in nine years had laid the foundation of
all that has since been done.
The Egyptians employed three kinds cf
Â¦writingâ the hieroglyphic and the. h!Â«rat
ic, used especially by the priests anl the
demotic, of later origin and less import
ance, used by the people. The hiero
glyphic Is composed of pictures and con
ventional signs, some of which represent
ideas and others mere sounds. Thua, for
instance, the picture of a vulture is 'irawn
to signify the word, and such a picture Is
called an ideograph. The phonetic signs,
on the other hand, form a' sort of ilpha
bet and in a curious, primitive way
Thus the word for lion (as In English) br
gins with L, and accordingly the picture
of a lion is made to stand for the sound
L; the word for noose begins with O, r.r.J
the picture of a noose does duty for tNat
letter. The hieratic was a cursive hand
derived from the hieroglyphic, and was
adopted by the priests as more readily
written than the other.
Inscriptions on stone reach back as far
as the fourth dynastyâ that is, to about
4500 It. C. Besides these there are pre
served in the tombs and elsewhere Innu
merable writings on wood and manu
scripts on a sort of paper made of strips
of the Inner fiber of the papyrus reed. In
this way the bulk of Egyptian documents
that have come down to ua is enormous,
extending over a period of about 4000 years
and embracing almost every branch of
literature. Perhaps the most interesting
of the?e documents to us (apart from the
famous "Book of the Dead") are the short
stories, a considerable number of which
have been published in easily accessible
translations. For example, "Egyptian
Tales." edited by W. M. Flinders Petrie,
two volumes: Methuen & Co.. 1395.
It cannot be claimed that these stories
have great intrinsic value as literature.
PTOLEMY II AN -r >
BERNICE.
PTOLEMY I AND
ARSIXOE
(Gold coin struck to announce the deification
of Ptolemy I and his wife.)
But. on the other hand, they do possess
what commonly forms the chief interest
of exotic works; they enable us to trans
port ourselves to strange lands and past
times, and so to extend our sympathies.
To read these stories in chronological or
der would show us that In Egypt fiction
passed through stages very similar to ths
growth of tho modern novel, and as Mr.
Flinders Petrie observes: "It would not
be dllHcult from these papyrus tales -to
start an historical dictionary of the ele
msnts of fiction."
The best of the tales are "The Ship
wrecked Sailor" and "Anpu and Bata."
The former is the story of a sailor cast
upon a magic Island, where he has a
strange adventure with a monstrous ser
pent. "Suddenly." the tale goes. "I heard
a noise as of thunder, which I thought to
be that of a wave of the sea. The trees
shook and the earth was moved. I uncov
ered nay face and I saw that the serpent
drew near. He was thirty cubits long and
his beard greater than two cubits; hi?
body was as overlaid with gold and his
color as that of true lazuli." The other
story, that of the two brothers. "Anpu
acd Bata," tells In simple, beautiful lan
guage the well-known Incident of Joseph
and Potlphar's wife, and this la the more
interesting to us because it Vas probably
enough written about the time of Jo-
Beph/s sojourn in Egypt. There Is, too.
real delineation of character in the story,
and the picture of the young Bata leading
the cattle to the pasture in the morning
and bringing them back in the evening,
with its quaint touches of old world com
munion with nature, forms an idyl of
genuine and permanent value.
Careful study of documents and Inscrip
tions the world over has of course given
REV. B. FAY MILLS TO
SPEAK HERE NEXT SUNDAY
Arrangements have bÂ«-en made for Rev.
Benjamin Fay Mills to deliver in Metro
politan Temple next Sunday at 4 p. m. the
address which attracted the largest con
gregation that ever assembled in the Uni
tarian church at Oakland, filling audito
rium, Sunday school room, parlors, dining
room, galleries and vestibules. The sub
ject was "The Claims of Liberal Religion
on the Modern World.". and it was one of
Mr. Mills' finest efforts. He is said to
have lost none of his evangelical fervor
and magnetic power which ne had when
he attracted audiences of several thou
sand night after night during five weeks
to the Mechanics' Pavilion eight years
ago.
In 1575 Mr. 'Mills was a clerk in a real
estate olÃce in this city. When he was 2J
years of age he passeo. his theological ex-,
amination and was ordained to the Con
gregational ministry. He was a promi
nent evangelist for several years, holding
revival meetings with satisfactory results
to all that were associated with him.
Seven years ago he delivered an address
at the Parliament -of- Religions on the
topic. "Christ the Savior of the World."
He gradually changed his theological
views until he announced himself as a
minister ot the Unitarian denomination,
and for two years he preached to large
congregations in Music Hall and HolUs
street Theater, In Boston. He worked at
hfgh pressure, as Is his way, and It be
came necessary for him to take a rest
'and a change of climate. He came to Sac
rampnto upon private business, and the
pastorate of the Unitarian church. Oak

and longer if he should desire to do so.
He has nad large congregations and has
awakened a great interest in religious
subjects. The church people desire that
he should continue hiÂ« services, but he la
undecided In regard to his future field of
work.
His many friends in this city want him
to speak here before he leaves the coast.
He has signified his willingness to do so if
â¢ Sunday afternoon will be acceptable.
Those who have charge of the meeting
assured Mr. Mills that he will have a
warm greeting by very appreciative hear
ers. They also assure those who differ
from him that they will be pleased with
the presentation of his. opinions and ad
mire his spirit of tolerance and charity.
All are cordially invited.

Kinstry is a Democrat in politics and a lawyer of high standing and ability.
His appointment will doubtless prove highly satisfactory to all who are in
terested.

E. W. McKinstry, and with his father is a partner in the law firm of Stan
ly, McKinstry, Bradley & McKinstry. He is a native of San Francisco and a

institution he received his diploma in ISM. He then went to Spokane Falls.
"Wash., where he began the practice of his profession as a partner with George
Turner, now representing- the State of Washington in the United States Sen
ate. After five year-s in the north he returned to this city arid entered the
firm with which he is at present associated.
In an interview yesterday afternoon Mr. McKinstry said that the appoint
ment tendered him by the Mayor came as a surprise, as he had not been
consulted until his name had been announced. "I had as lleve try my hand,
though," said he. "and will take up my new duties with a determination to
fulfill them to the letter." : : ..;;.Â¦ .

1. THE LITEBATUEE OF EGYPT.
BY PROF. PAUL ELMER MORE.
Harvard University.
Even to the men of ancient Greece ar.d
Rome. Egypt was a land of darkness,
and to us of to-day something of the
old mystery and allurement still attach
to the dwellers on the Niie. Herodotus
brought away admiration for thlj peo
ple, whom he visited, because, as he said,
they did everything- exactly opposite to
the rest of the world. And Plato de-.lared
the Greeks were but children. Ignorant of
life, in comparison with the riper clvllijs
tion of Egypt. From a careful study of
Inscriptions and papyrus manuscripts w.Â»
have come to know many things about
the land that were dark to the wine men
of Athens. We know that the Greek- oi<l
not learn nearly so much as they thoupht
from the priests of the Nile, and we know
that Herodotus' account of the Egyptian
religion is in some important particu'ars
quite false, but we have still much to
discover. Yet in one respect our fceil:ig
toward the land has not changed from
that of Plato and his contemporaries. Itr
civilization ia indeed old. and gives us
authentic records that go farther back
probably than any others of the wot Id.
and a strange immutability seemel to
possess the land. It is this antiquity and
immutability' that more than anytMntr
else lend a mystery to the people of the
Nile. The vast pyramids, the solemn
temples, the placid reiterated forma cf
sculpture, the Sphinx staring out upon
infinityâ all these affect us with the srun
awe of magnitude and lor.gr enduring time
that aroused the wonder of ancient trav
elers.
Even the written language of the ia.iid
impresses us in the same way. and there
is no more romantic chapter in the his
tory of scholarship than the deciphering:
of the hieroglyphs. In I'M one of Napo

BUTTEW CHANGES PROBABLE
Says He Will Be Guided by Their In
structions in His Course Toward.
Chinatown and Other
Evils.
Chief ,of Â¦ Police Sullivan assumed the
duties' of his new office at t 1 o'clock yes
terday afternoon.- There was no "fuss or
feathers" about his introduction as the
head of San Francisco's Police depart
ment: He just took his seat at the chiefs
desk and commenced to issue orders as
if to the manner born.
Ex-Aettne. Chief Biggy was in the office
early in the morning preparing to make
the transfer to his successor. He sent
a messenger to Mr. Sullivan to ascertain
if he should remain In the offlceuntil the
latter was ready to take possession. Chief
Sullivan advised Mr. Biggy that he could
consult his own convenience in the, mat
ter. He was not certain as to the, hour
when he would assume charge of the de
partment and for that reason suggested
that Mr. Biggy turn everything over to
Captain Wlttman. Mr. Biggy retired at
once and for several hours the captain
was, in charge of the department. - It was
nearly 1 o'clock in the afternoon before
Chief Sullivan had wound up his affairs
as the Mayor's secretary and perfected
his $25,0.0 bond as Chief of Police. The
Pacific Guarantee Company is his surety.
When he entered his new office a large
number of his friends- awaited him and
offered their, hearty congratulations.
According to Chief SulWvanTi statement
he will make haste slowly in regard to
any radical changes that may be found
necessary in the department. It is his
intention to map out a complete policy
with relation to Chinatown, the Nymphia
and similar places and to the nickel-ln
the-slot macnincs. In. all these matters
he proposes to work in harmony with the
Police Commission. He will make no
move without consulting the members and
will be guided entirely by their advice.
"It will take some time." said Chief Sul
livan, "to become familiar with my duties
as chief, but I will do so as rapidly as
possible. In the meantime I am not in a
position to say anything about probable
changes in the department. There has
been some talk about the detective force
being reorganized, but I can pee no neces
sity for putting a new man at its head
just at present. The charter provides for
a detective force' nearly double in size to
that now employed, but the Supervisors
have made no provisions for paying the
salaries of the additional men. which pre
cludes the possibility of appointing them.
"I will map out a complete policy of
the course I will pursue toward China
town, the Nymphia and the nlekcl-in-the
slot machines. Previous to taking any
action I .will consult the commissioners
and will look to them for Instructions."
The new chief expres%ed a determina
tion to treat all of the* attaches of the
upper office with the utmost fairness.
He does not contemplate making any
changes in the personnel of the staff, but
if such should be found necessary- It would
be with the idea of appointing superior
men to fill the vacancies.
Captain Bohen. the present captain of
detectives, wants less than two months
to serve the three years required under
the altered condition in the charter to en
title him to the benefit of the Increased
pay on retiring. There la no probability
of any changes being made in that branch
of the department until then.
The Mayor yesterday appointed Charles
\V. Fay his private secretary to succeed
Colonel William P. Sullivan Jr., appointed
Chief of Police. It is understood that
Fays appointment is of a temporary
character. but it is quite likely that it
will be made permanent.

7CHICAGO, Feb. 14.â Disappointing cables in
fluenced wheat early. May opening %c under
yesterday at 68,Â«Â«*t>S%c. Later the market
rallied to 654@68%c for May on a Berlin cable
announcing damages to the German crop and
New York messages reporting the Continent
a good buyer. There was not much substantial
support, however, and trading dropped off con
siderably as the session advanced. May grad-.
ually easing off to 68 l ie Near the end of the
sesÃlon a sharp advance was caused by the
decrease in the world's visible supply, a re
purt that Kansas City had sold eighteen boat
loads for export via gulf ports and the as
sertion that local sale* for export were good.
Shorts were good buyers on the reaction, which
carried May to 69c. The close was firm. May
HÂ®Vic up at 68% c.
Corn was fairly active, more or less In
fluenced by wheat. Cash business was large.
May closed U<S%c up at 34HÂ©34^c.
The oats market was steady and a fair
amount of trade was done. May closed un
changed at 23% c.
Provisions were Irregular, firm In the mid
dle but easy at both ends of the session.
Lower prices for hogs was the chief influence
in the depression. Trade was dull. The high
point was reached on light offerings and buy-
Ing by shorts. May pork closed 5@74c under
yisterday. May lard closed 2V4c lower and
May ribs closed unchanged at $5 974.

AYtc York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 14.â The stock market to
Â£ay showed a continuance of yesterday's
â¢trength in the *>arly dealings, but the buying
demand rame almost altogether from profes
sional sources with the purpose of Inviting out
elde densand. The outside demand failed to
materialize, business from the eommisÃion
houses continuing on a small scale. In fact
â¢filing orders to some extent came on the
market from the ommlsslon bouses which
Â¦was attributed to Western account, but v/trre
without explanation. The professional buyer*
â¢rrtw tired and sold to realize when the fu
tility of the attempts to attract outside buy-
Ing was perceived. Several points of porltlve
weakness were developed by the marching
rtlnrus of the b^arÂ» and stop-loss orders were
covered by offering price* down. The result
Â¦was a general reactionary tendency which
wiped out practically all of the earlier gain
and established Borne eharp losses in special
â¢tncks. The shorts covered before the close,
causing sharp rallies at the weak spots find
a jreneral stiffening of the whole market, as
a reÂ«ult of which the closing was firm and
ret changes in -the majority of stocks small.
The local traction stocks and the Industrials
were the leadeit In the opening advance.
Sugar. Tobacco, Western Union. People's Gas.
I'reaced Steel. Rubber preferred and some of
the iron and etcel stocks were all represented
toy rains of 1 to 1H and" Tennessee Coal was
up Srr on rumors of a plan to retire the pre
ferred stock and begin dividends on the com
mon stock. Continued heavy buying was la
evidence In Pennsylvania, Baltimore and Ohio,
St. Paul. Missouri Pacific and other stocks,
those named rising a point. Buying of some
of these were attributed !to operations by
rperulatlve -pools. The first point of weakness
to develop was Third Avenue on the announce
ment of a dividend of only 1 per cent, as com
j>ared with IVi per cent for the last quarter of
1899 and 1\ per cent for the three preceding
years. The stock fell an extreme 4\ and
caused Â»->-m pathetic weakness in the other
local traction stocks. Metropolitan West Side
preferred (Chicago) Jumped SH points on the
declaration of Its flrat dividend. The demand
for etocks was llrtlem for the rest of the day
and the bean made successive attacks on dif
ferent stocks. Rubber common and preferred
lost 4"-* /! '< i * points respectively. Continental
Tobacco was raided down S points on rumors
of a bond lrsue and American Tobacco lost Its
earlier gain In sympathy. Sugar fell 14 from
the top. Federal Bteel IH. Pacific Mall IVi and

New York mall advices say of Raisins:
"Trade in raisins Is confined to such orders as
naturally come to holders without special ef
forts In California loose Muscatels the pres
ent condition appears likely to remain un
changed for some time to come. The total sup
ply left in all positions is barely enough to
carry the trade through until the next crop Is
ready for distribution. There are almost none
In first hands, and what there are in second
hands are closely controlled. Foreign raisins
are very dull, and orders are so small that they
amount to virtually no business." .

BOSTON. Feb. 14.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
The market has been very quiet, although In
the past day or two there have been evidence*
of a slightly improved inquiry and some sample
bags have been taken. Hoavy cancellations of
goods are reported, but In many cases these
are due to the fact that the goods were not up
to the quality of last year. But if the situa
tion of the manufacturers had bean correctly
reported they would welcome cancellation as
they are so heavily oversold. Consumers are
purchasing but very little wool, and except for
the sale of two or three good-sized lots of car
pet and cross-bred wools the aggregate business
of the week would figure small. Prices are
firm on low wools, but fine wools are dull.
The sales of the week in Boston amounted to
2.784,000 pounds domestic and 1.555.000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 4.363.000. against a
total of 3.3?1.000 for the previous week and a
total of 4.367,500 for the corresponding week
last year. The sales since January 1 amount
to 25.854,600 pounds, against 26,5C5.Â»)0 pounds
for the corresponding time last year.

Pier 11Mysterious Fire on Paris Street
The residence and furniture belonging
to Bymen Blywlse at 230 Paris street, be
tween Silver avenue and Brazil street,
were destroyed by fire yesterday after
noon. There was something of a mystery
attending the fire. In the first instance
Engine Company 32, located at Holly
Park and West street, was called out on
a still alarm, and after arriving at the
place indicated there was nothing to call
for its service. The company had just
returned to its house when an alarm came
in from box 661. This was responded to,
and when Captain Eugene O'Connor ar
rived with his engine he found a fire mak
ing headway on the cottage. There being
no hydrants nearer than Mission street
he was compelled to run his hose into the
water tanks of one of the vegetable
gardens close by. The supply, however,
was Inadequate to do any service, and
the fire was permitted to have Its way,
while a second alarm was turned in from
an adjoining box by some person who saw
the flames from a distance. This had the
effect of bringing engines 33 and 18 to the
scene, but their attendance was as useless
as that of 32 because of the lack of hy
drants. ' Â«
The cauÃÂ« of the fire la unknown. The
premises were Insured for their" full
value.

YOUNG AND FOOLISH.
Oden Zoebag Attempts to End His
Life by Swallowing Morphine.
A well dressed man about 25 years
of age walked Into a saloon on the
corner of Third and Minna streets yester
day afternoon and ordered a beer served
to him in one of the boxes. A few min
utes later he staggered Into the bar and
fell on the floor, exclaiming that he had
poisoned himself. He was sent to th-e
Receiving Hospital, where it was found
that he had swallowed a dose of mor
phine. The usual remedies were applied
and he was soon pronounced out of dan
ger. The would-be suicide said his name
was Oden Zoebagr, but he refused to give
any reason for trying to take his life. In
his pockets was found a note addressed
to J. S. Hall, 25 H<yzog street, Portland,
In which he said: .
"I could not make it, so it Is useless for
me to stay any longer. Good-by. I'll do
as I threatened and I won't worry any
longer. ODEN."

"While getting over the grip, and
while my stomach was so irritable I
could not eat anything without distress,
I found I could take a dish of Grape-
Nuts with rich milk, and feel built up
like I had eaten a full meal, and yet
have none of the unpleasant effects of
indigestion. I wish people knew its
worth. . .'Â¦'.â¢'

Grape-Xuts Food is now recommend-
ed by physicians all over the United
States. They know it contains the deli-
cate particles of phosphate of potash
obtained from the natural grains. This
is the element Nature uses vvitli albu-
men of the food to build the soft gray
substance in the nerve centers, brain
and solar plexus, in the human body.
The effect is in some ways like a stimu-
lant, but does not wear off, for it is a
natural rebuilding.
Grape-Nuts can be made into a >?rcat
many different and palatable dishes.
The Postum Cereal Co., Ltd., Battle
Creek, Mich., the pure food manufac-
turers, offer to pay a reasonable sum
for new and desirable recipes which
may meet with their approval. Ladies
are requested to experiment and send
in .their recipes. As an illustration: A
most delicious mock pumpkin pie can
be made from Grape-Nuts after the fol-
lowing recipe: Pour boiling water over

minutes; add 2 egj^s, 4 tablespoonfuls of
sugar, 2 cups sweet milk, one-third tea-

oughly boiled. Bake pie dough in deep

PREVENTS SUICIDE
OAKLAND. Feb. 14.â The look of de
spair on M. L Goodwin's face when
he applied at an Allendale Tract
drugstore for 15 cents' worth of
laudanum prevented another suicide being
recorded last night. Instead of giving the
would-be suicide a fatal concoction the
drug clerk substituted a harmless sleeping
potion. This Goodwin swallowed with
suicidal Intent. He closed his eyelids in
the firm belief that he would never open
them again in this world. This he admit
ted when he awoke from a deep, sonorous
sleep this morning. "I was tired of life
and wanted to Bhufne off," he said. His
rash but poorly managed act Is a surprise

Town Trustees. The Trustees claimed
that the rescinding of the liquor licenses
would mean a considerable financial loss
to the town. At that time fully 52700 a
year was turned into the treasury from
licenses. The amount of the license was
reduced later, howevar, to average SISOO a
year. The Trustees could not see any
way to make up the deficiency in the
treasury which the closing of the saloons
would cnuse.
Then A. W. Naylor and J. L. Barker,
two of the most prominent business men
in Berkeley, came to the rescue and guar
anteed the payment each year of the sum
of JISOO so that no loss would be sustained
by the town. " . "
The Trustees entered into an agreement
with these gentlemen whereby $450 was
to be paid on the 10th of January and
every quarter thereafter. Having guar
anteed this amount to the town the
women then undertook to raise this sum
by subscription in order to keep Mr. Bar
ker and Mr. Naylor from actual loss.
That subscriptions might be received
Miss A. M. Hicks, president of the Berke
ley W. C. T. U., sent circulars broadcast
into the State. Over ISOO petitions and
subscription blanks were sent to the par
ents of the students of the university. The
petition set forth "that the fight will be a
fierce one and we need the support of
every father and mother In California in
behalf of whose eons and daughters this
war is being waged." In a short time sev
eral hundred dollars was in the treasury
to carry on the fight against the liquor
men. Subscriptions were received from
branches of the W. C. T. U. In various
parts of the State, from churches and
fr'">m many parents of the students.
The first installment of this contract
price was paid on January 10 and there
is now a balance In the treasury of the
committee toward the present quarter.
Now no saloons exist openly, though
there are many places where one may sat
isfy his thirst "if you know where to go
in Berkeley," as the college song has it.
The front doors are closed and nailed,
while the side entrances satisfy "ac
quaintances." Still, the temperance work
ers are satisfied, as the saloon men are
gradually dropping out of existence and
seeking quarters elsewhere.
Miss A. M. Hicks, the prime mover in
the crusade, said: "We have had a hard
fight to accomplish our end. but the satis
faction it gives us to know that our end
Is gained more than pays us for our la
bors. We have worked diligently for over
a year and will never let up until there
is not a drop of liquor sold in Berkeley.
As this is the center of culture and
education, and also the strongest place
of the liquor men. our victory has been
all the more great. We went Into the
den. grappled with the demon and came
out victorious. It was a severe blow to
the saloon keepers and to the liquor men
throughout the State and a great strength
to the Anti-Saloon League. Hundreds. I
might say thousands, of dollars have been
spent by the liquor men to down our
cause. It meant much to them. If the
courts had upheld them in the Berkeley
cases their other flehts in various parts
of the State would nave been easy. We
are receiving subscriptions daily, will con
tinue to employ our attorney, Mr. Gray,
ar.d will keep up the work of endeavor
ing to close all saloons."
A. W. Naylor, president of the Commer
cial Bank of Berkeley, said: "I have been
interested In the closing of the saloons
from the start. I think they are an evil
which should not exist, and especially In
a college town where there are so many
young men. Many of them are away from
home for the first time, are of an Im
pressionable age and open more or less
to temptation. The morals of the stu
dents and the community at large has
been greatly benefited by the closing of
the saloons, and I will certainly do my
small part in assisting the ladles and men
interested in the temperance cause."
BERKELEY, Feb. 14.â The people of
Berkeley so wanted the saloon
abolished in the college town that
they are paying into the tovn
treasury the sum of $ISOO a year which
the town would have received from sa
loon licenses in order that the town be not
financially embarrassed. This sum is
guaranteed In regular agreement form by
two gentlemen and the money is raised by
Fubscriptlon from the families of unlvrr-
Etty students all over the State. The
DXBt payment was made last month under
the agreement, and upon no other condi
tion would the Trustees abolish saloons.
This is the most unique method In the
world of securing prohibition, and the
Btrkeleyans who are behind the scheme
are standing Ly their bargain with the
Town Trustees to the extent of IISOO In
cash every year. There are few cases on
record where so sir.ctre a movement was
made at such a cost.
The "mile limit'" State law prohibitirg
the sale of liquor within a mile of the
State University has always existed, and
within the last year that "limit" has
been stretched to enter Berkeley, a dis
trict of probably nine square miles. This
was accomplished only after the hardest
fight by citizens of Berkeley Interested in
temperance work, and a submission of the
question to a vote of the town.
As a result of this prohibition there does
not erist at present the wildly- exciting
tiroes that West Berkeley particularly
saw a year or more ago. There are no
more beer busts Indulged in by college
student*, and there are no more ""jolly"
times as th<re used to be.
Now Berkeley is strictly temperance
and as quiet, as the proverbial church
mouse. It is an unusual thing to see an
Intoxicated person on the streets. All this
has been brought about by a society of
ladles backed by the financial aid of sev
eral prominent citizens.
Several months ago a number of ladles
met Informally and discussed the liquor
evil existing in the college town. From
a mere discussion of the subject giew
concentrated action. A committee of
twtnty-one In which Rev. J. R. Knodell,
Professor Woodworth. H. L Gear, Rev. E.

HIS LIMP FORM
HURLED AROUND
WITH A WHEEL
Awful Experience of a
Little Schoolboy.
... v
Oakland/Office San Francisco Call.
v-'lllS Broadway, Feb. 14.
Little Tom McKeon, the 9-year-old son
of Matthew McKeon, residing at 736 Cen
ter street, had his right leg caught be
tween the spokes of a rapidly moving
peddler's wagon this afternoon and ex
perienced one of the most remarkable
narrow escapes from death on record. He
was hurled about with the revolution of
the wheel and his leg was so badly
broken that he will probably have to lose
It. He may die.
The boy is a pupil In Miss Abbott's class
at the Tompklns School on Fifth street,
near Linden. Aa ha reached the street
after his class had been dismissed he
was invited by Manuel Sllva. a West Oak
land peddler, to ride home with him. The
peddler already had Earl Reader, another
12-year-old schoolboy, by his side. The
wagon stopped and Tommy McKeon was
In the act of getting aboard. He had
reached the wheel step at the hub and
was about to climb up to the scat, when
the horse suddenly shied. The Jolt caused
the boy to slip and his right leg became
entangled between the spokes and, losing
hia grip, his body was hurled around with
great velocity by the revolution of the
wheel. When Sllva finally succeeded in re
gaining control of his horse and the
wagon was stopped little Tommy's form
hung limp, head down. The wheel and
body of the wagon were blood-besprlnkled.
The boy was carried to the .Receiving
Hospital unconscious. Drs. Stratton,
Rowe and Porter were, promptly sum
moned. Although the boy had regained
consciousness and related the particulars
of the accident as he lay qn the operating
table, hia condition from the shock was
such that the necessary amputation of the
leg was delayed. The doctors deemed that
it might prove fatal. The knee cap was
gone and four inches of the femur was
exposed. His condition this evening is
such that It Is feared he may die.

The latter was somewhat late, and an â¢
effort was being made to make up the
lost time. " .
Neither crew apparently paid any
attention to the crossing, and both
cars attempted to pass at the same
time. The result was a crash. Each
crew Is now blaming the other fcr the ,
accident.

IS PART OF A BIG SCHEME
Competition Becomes So Strong That
the Southern Pacific .Has Pro
jected a New Route From
Los Angeles to Ogden.
H. E. Huntington, J. C. Stubbs, R. P.
Schwerln and William Sprouie returned to
their offices in the Southern Pacific build
ing yesterday afternoon from the south-
em part of the State. Mr. Huntington,
who has been East for some time paot,
returns to this city with his authority
fully restored and as the acknowledged
representative of his uncle. on this coast.
He has no official title, but is, neverthe
less, the ranking ofllcer of the Southern
Pacific and the personal representative of
the president of the road at the San
Francisco end.
Mr. Huntington when seen yesteioay
gave out the information that the South
ern Pacific had purchased the Carson ana
Colorado Railway, a line running from
Mound House, Nov., to Keeler, lnyo
County, in this State, a distance of abcut
193 miles. Connected with this property
is a short seven-mile branch from Junc
tion to Candelaria, in Nevada, which was
also purchased by the Southern Pacific
people.
According to Mr. Huntington the reason
of this purchase is to afford the Southern
Pacific Company a shorter and more di
rect line from Los Angeles and Southern
California points to the East.
Some time ago the company made ap
plication at the Government Land Ollice
at Independence, in lnyo County, for a
right of way from Mchave to Keelor. a
distance of between eighty and a hun
dred miles. Connecting with the Southern
Pacific line at the former point, a broad
gauge road will be constructed through
San Bernardino and lnyo Counties to
Keeler, where It will be joined to the re
cently acquired property.
This railroad is now a narrow-gauge
affair, but will be remodeled and made
Into a modern broad-gauge road and will
be connected at Its northern end, some
where in the vicinity of Churchill, with
the Central Pacific by a link, some thirty
miles long, which is to be constructed so
as to join the main line of the Central
Pacific somewhere In the vicinity of
Wadsworth. This will give the Southern
Pacific a through line from Los Angeles
and the southern part of the State to
Ogden and all points in the East.
The necessity of such a move on the
part of the Southern Pacific Company has
been apparent for a long time past and
has been made even more necessary by
the recent action on the part of the Ore
gon Short Line, which has started the
construction of a line from Central Idaho
to Southern California. The Santa te
already possesses the most direct and
feasible route from the lower end of our
State to -the East, and when the Idaho
line is finished It would have the Â«jfre<jt
of placing the Southern Pacific in a very
cramped position between its two rivals
had it not some direct outlet of its owu
to depend on. ,
Moreover, the new line, besides devel
oping and acquiring the business of a
large and extremely productive section
of country, will do away with the tre
mendous- grades .of the Tehachapi Pa^a
and the passes now used through the bl
erras and will reduce the operating ex
penses of the company, while providing
at the same time a far safer route of
travel. The grade will be reduced to 1
per cent, or nfty feet in the mile rrom
Mojave to Oregon. 'J ';>â¢Â¦*

THEY "GAMMED"
CHRISTMAS DAY
IN MIDOCEAN
Columbia and Dalny
Vostok Meet.
THE AZTEC ' HEARD FROM
Steamer Kinau Arrives From Maka-
well With Sugarâ Cleveland Sails
for Kahului â Main-Street
Wharf to Be Extended.
The transport Dalny Vostok arrived
from Manila via Nagasaki yesterday. At
the latter port the officers had some
'trouble with the Chinese crew, and In con
sequence all the Mongolians deserted.
Japanese were shipped to fill the vacan
cies and the vessel made the run to Sari
Francisco in twenty-two days, which Is a
; fair performance considering the firemen
and coal passers did not know the easiest
way to handle the furnaces. Captain
Erickson, who went out aa master of the
vessel, left her In Manila, and Captain
Gow, who was formerly chief officer of
the transport Tacoma, brought her home.
Captain Erickson was sick when he left
: here, and his ailment becoming worse he
left the vessel and went homo via Hong-
The Dalny Vostok and the Columbia
had probably the most unique experience
In the history of old ocean. They were
in company on Christmas day and
gammed. The Columbia had the head
quarters and band of the Forty-seventh
Regiment and a few companies aboard,
while the rest of the men were on the
Dalny Vostok. A stage was erected on
the Columbia's quarterdeck and another
on the Dalny Vostok amidships. A double
concert was held,, speeches were made,
toasts given and everybody on the two
transports fraternized as though they
were ashore and holiday good-fellowship
! was the order of the day.
â¢ The Dalny Vostok "and the Columbia
left here on November 23 last with the
Forty-seventh Regiment for Manila. They
reached ' Honolulu together and left that
port in company December 11. On Christ
mas day they were both within a week's
sail of Honolulu, and the crewa of both
steamers determined to have a right royal
celebration. At noon, after the observa
tion had been taken on both vessels and
both navigating officers were satisfied
that it was really Christmas day the ves
sels came together under a slow bell. It
was a perfect day and the ocean was a
"sea of glass." All hands were mustered
for the show and the band of the regi
ment was told to bring out all Its musje.
Tables were laid on the deck of each vessel
and many a toast passed from ship to
ship. When the men on the Dalny Vostok
were ready to put forth a singer they
would shout the name of the song and the
band on the Columbia would begin the
accompaniment. In this way songs and
speeches and toasts were interchanged
until darkness fell upon the scene.
The transport Aztec, which left here
January 10 for Manila via Hilo, H. LÂ» has
at last been heard from. Owing to the
plague in Honolulu no news has come
from the other islands of the group, and
in consequence no news has come from
the outside ports. The Aztec reached
Hilo on January 19 and landed her stock
the next day. Nine of the animals died
during the passage and had the stop not
been made at least half of Â¦ the cargo
would have been lost, as the animals were
not healthy when shipped. Ab it was their
week's stay at Hawaii did them a great
amount of good and they were aa fat as
butter when- put back aboard the Aztec
on January 26. The vessel was to have
sailed the next day for Manila, but was
detained until January 29 on account of
heavy weather. While at Hilo the trans
port took aboard 30,000 gallons of water
and considerable feed for the animals.
While towing a barge out to her the
launch Lurline was swamped, but luckily
the captain and crew escaped. The Ht
tle steamer was afterward raised and Is
now In good shape again. Captain C. P.
Matson of the ship Falls of Clyde, who
went down as pilot of the Aztec, and
Captain Johnson of the bark Roderick
Dhu took charge of the landing and load-
Ing again of the Aztec's cargo, and Cap
tain Trask of the transport says thai the
work was better done than it was in Hon
olulu, with all its facilities, on thu last
voyage of the Aztec.
The transport Columbia docked at the
Harrtson-street wharf yesterday. The
Dalny Vostok is in quarantine. The Sher
man began loading for Manila and will
probably get away next Monday. The
Indiana has been rechartered and will go
on the drydock to-day. She will then load
for the Philippines. â¢
The Hawaiian steamer Kinau arrived
frcm Makaweli yesterday with a load of
sugar for Alexander & Baldwin. Di.
Kinyoun placed her in quarantine and the
vessel wlu be fumigated before she is al
lowed to dock. Owing to the plague on
Oahu Island there has been no communi
cation between Kauai and Honolulu, so
the planters have been forced to put on
an extra steamer In order to get some of
their products to a home port. The Kinau
will discharge as quickly as possible and
go back with a load of general merchan
dise to Makaweli.
The steamer Cleveland, under charter
to Alexander &. Baldwin, sailed for Kahu
lui and Hana. Hawaiian Islands, yester
day. She will bring back a cargo of sugar
The assistant cook mado trouble at Hailing

LOTTEBY DRAWING.

OUR TRADE WITH
THE FAR EAST
Use of the Commer
cial Museum. â¢
BERKELEY. Feb. 14.â Professor C. C.
Plehn of the University of California, who
Is one of the organizers of the Pacific
Commercial Museum, has received a letter
from E. \V. S. Tingle, assistant to Dr.
William P. Wilson, director of tha Phila
delphia Commercial Museum, with a very
Important bearing upon the. California at
tempt. The letter In part Is aa follows:
The value of active co-operation 'between, the
two Institutions Is certain, considering the fact
that we have expended over a million dollars
In reaching the point which we have attained
and viewing- the further fact that by means of
our correspondents and through our own offi
cials, . sent out to various parts of the world,
we have built up a chain of communication
whose links cover practically every country,
the value to yon of free access to this fount
of Information need not be dwelt upon.
On the other hand our experience teachea us
that there It work enough to be done In the
Orient alone to engage to Its fullest the
activities of any Institution working along:
similar lines. Considering the geographical
position of San Francisco, the comparatively
easy communication between It and the Orient,
and the natural commercial opportunities
which could be expected to arise. If not aiready
existing between the Pacific Coast and the
Orient, It would seem that the establishment
of a commercial museum In Ban Francisco
whlth should have for Its sole task the de
velopment of our trade with the Orient would
be particularly fitting and valuable.
Our merchants, who now enjoy 7 per cent
of the rapidly increasing and enormously val
uable Chinese trade, are greatly â¢In need of
accurate and frequent Information regarding
the opportunities and changing commercial
condition* of China and the Orient generally.
A commercial museum In San Francisco in
providing this Information could perform a
work the value of which could not be reckoned
In dollars and cents, and in comparison with
which any sums contributed for Its support by
citizens of city or State would be Insignificant
no matter how great. Â».-â¢
The work of a commercial museum, speak
ing from our experience, falls naturally Into
these subdivisions:
First â The collection of all possible commer
cial literature regarding new markets, together
wMh the arrangement of a system of cor
respondents who will furnish not only the
literature but other fresh and up-to-date com
mercial Information.
Secondâ The furnishing of commercial Infor
mation both at request and without request to
merchants interested as to new markets and
the best methods of Invading them, together
with reports upon immediate opportunities for
the sale of goods, 'such as In bidding upon
contracts, government work. etc. In connec
tion with these reports it should also be ar
ranged to furnish the names of reliable mer
chants suitable as agents for American manu
factures, together with their responsibility and
credit standing generally.
Th lf*!"""* 'ThcrG ? tiou !<l be ft d^pftrtmdit devoted
to the collection and exhibition of goods Bold"
by competitive nations In the markets which
are to be Invaded.
All the other numerous subdepartments grow
naturally out of these three general divisions.

TO GUARD AGAINST DISASTER.
Fire Commissioners Want T-wo Fire-
men Placed in Each Place of
Amusement.
The Fire Commissioners at their last
meeting adopted a suggestion that for the
betler protection of life and property two
trained firemen in uniform should be
placed In each place of amusement In the
city during each performance. They
would give a. new sense of security to the
audience, and in the event of an Incipient
fire occurring a panic would be prevented
and the tire speedily extinguished.
Owing to the lack of funds it would be
necessary for the lessees of the places of

Yesterday Secretary Gorman sent a.
copy of the suggestion to the manager of
each place of amusement in the city, with
a request for a reply as soon as possible.
the bold, dashing, defiant, brazen
woman who luxuriated in the nau
sqous notoriety of a criminal trial a
little more than a year ago.
Only once or twice during the hour
she spent on the witness stand yes
terday did Mrs. Botkin give any evi
dence that the old fire still smouldered
In her breast, but those few lapsrs
Â¦were sufficient to show that the claws
of the tigress "were sheathed and not
drawn. These momentary flashes of
the old feline spirit were directly due
to the attempt of Attorney Redny,
who represented Mrs. Price, to bring
up the Botkin trial, and the attor
ney can hardly be said to have had the
better of the contest.
Mrs. Botkin was evidently laboring
under a great strain, but she made a
palpable and partially successful ef
fort to control her emotions, although
once or twice she quietly pressed a
handkerchief to her eyes to catch the
tears that gathered in spite of her.
Her voice was very low but clear and
distinct, and she still affected the
English accent which formerly was
the subject of more or less comment
and ridicule.' Her eyes were almost
continually on the floor and nearly
closed. Only when the old spirit
flared up for a fleeting moment did
she raise her head and open her eyes,
only to relapse a second later into the
attitude of mournful resignation,
which she seemed to have adopted for
the occasion. She testified that Mrs.
Price had confided to her the cause of
her sickness, and tho inference was
that W. W. Barnes, named as core
spondent in Mr. Price's cross bill, was
responsible for her condition. Attor
ney Reddy asked Mrs. Botkin if she
had repeated this information, given
her In confidence, before coming into
court.
"I never told any one. I'm telling
you now," murmured the witness.
Attorney Reddy persisted In his
question and Mrs.- Botkin said the In
formation was not confidential, as the
whole household knew it, and that she
sympathized with Mrs. Price In her
trouble. Judge Reddy wanted to know
if she was sorry for Mrs. Price when
she told Judge Allen, Mr. Price's at
torney.
"I regret any woman's misfortune,"
was the quiet answer.
"Did Mrs. Price testify in the caso
of the People vs. Botkin?" asked At
torney Reddy. **;: ;
"The records will show who were
the -witnesses in my case."
The question was repeated with a
semi-apology, but the only answer
was:
"I refer you to Knight & Heggerty."
"Do you mean to say you do not
remember whether Mrs. Price waa a
witness in that caso?" demanded At
torney Reddy. becoming Impatient.
Mrs. Botkin straightened up in her
seat anrl looked at her questioner with
wide-open eyes, and her white teeth
gleamed like those of an angry feline
as she answered in a low but distinct
voice:
"There was such an array of wit
nesses In petticoats that I could not
say."
"She would not remember anything
connected with her own trial, notwith
standing all the efforts of court and
counsel, and finally brought the matter
to a close with another feline smile as
she said:
"I did not come here for the purpose
of going over my disagreeable trial,
and I cannot say anything about the
witnesses In my case unless my coun
sel aro sent for."
Attorney Reddy made a final effort.
He said if the subject was disagree
able to witness he would simply ask
her to answer a few direct questions
and avoid any talk about her case. At
this point Mrs. Botkin interrupted him,
saying:
"There will be no talk anyway, for
I refuse to talk about it."
That settled it, and Mrs. Botkin was
soon after excused. She left the court
room silently, with bowed head and
downcast eyes, as she had entered it.
The trial of the divorce case went over
until to-day.
a commission was appointed to enter into
negotiations with a view to purchasing
the works. The SpMng Valley Company
at that time asked $16,000,000 and the city
offered $11,000,000. Finally, after a number
of conferences, the Spring Valley came
down to $13,000,000. Since that time I have
.asked our secretary to make out a state
ment of the amount of money expended
from the year 1577, the time the offer was
made, till the year 18M, both inclusive,
and his report shows expenditures in that
time of $15,839,220 16."
These expenditures. It was explained,
were for construction and for the pur
chase of reservoir sites, riparian rights,
etc. â¢
"If the city," continued Mr. Schussler,
"concluded to allow the company $11,000,000
In 1877, and $16,000,000 has been expended
since that time In construction and the
acquisition of lands and rightsâ and I
know the workÃ are worth a great deal
more than they costâ l would say they are
worth $30,000,000 as they stand to-day."
At the request of the Mayor the wit
ness presented the following figures to
represent what had been spent in con
struction from 1890 to 1899:
1830 $589,403 66
1831 : 683.196 70

189S â¢ 1,133,279 22
1899 708,43*44
Total .$5,687,777 69
Before he concluded his testimony Mr.
Schussler was taken over the entire sys
tem and described the great Calaveras
watershed and called attention to the
fact that Colonel Mendell, the present
head of the Board of Public Works, had
once made an estimate of a system. Col
onel Mendell was called to the stand and
was asked by the Mayor If he had made a
report on the value of the Spring Valley
AVater -Company in 1877. He said that he
did not think that he had valued It except
by comparisonâ the valuation was made
by him without , close' examination. He
said there seemed to be a great many peo
ple who seemed to be desirous" that- the
city should purchase it for $12,000,000 and
get a vexed question ' out . of. tho way.
Mayor Phelan asked the witness what
would be his estimate in round numbers
of the cost of bringing water, from tho
Sierras, but Colonel Mendell said he
could not answer the question on the spot,
as he had not given it much attention for
thirty-three years.
The question of storing: that water, if
brought here, was gone Into at length,
and Colonel Mendell gave It as his opin
ion that reservoir sites In this city would
be absolutely essential and were abso
lutely indispensable. In answer to other
questions he said that he had made an
examination of the Los Angeles water
system and estimated its value, but he
was unable to say Just how long it would
take or . what method would be best to
pursue to arrive at the valuation of the
Spring Valley Company's works. With
reference to the Lake Merced site. Col
onel Mendell said he thought the unoccu
pied land around the lake was necessary
for the use of the company and the wa
ter supply. He did not think the Spring
Valley could get along very well without
It, even if it should be used for park
purposes and if It were provided with a
perfect sewer system.
Testimony given In IS9B by Colonel
Mendell was produced in which he said
that the construction of a single pipe line

SPRING VALLEY UNDER
THE FIRE OF INQUIRY
Colonel Mendel! and the Mayor
Fail to Agree.
The Investigation Results in Some Inter
esting Testimony and Several Sur
prises Not on the Cards.
THE Board of Supervisors resumed
last night the investigation of the
water question preparatory to the es
tablishment of the rates for a year.
The inquiry was unique in that it pos
sessed general interest and ehed consid
erable lipht upon the project so often dis
ouss=ed of supplying this city with water
from the Sierra*. This problem was con
ddered by such experts as Aermann
Schossler'of the Spring Valle* Water
Company and by Colonel Mendell of the
Hoard of Public Works. Stranger per
haps than the fact of such a discussion
was the practical agreement of the ex
perts upon the conditions of securing
such a supply. The board through- the
questioning of the Mayor attempted also
to secure more information in relation to
the value of the Spring Valley plant and
Its treatment and alleged discrimination
lor and against patrons. The inquiry- will
Ye resumed to-morrow night.
Hermann Schussler, chief engineer of
the Spring Valley Water Company, was
the first witness of tlie evening. In an
ewer to a scries of queries he told what
he knows of the construction and operat
ing expenses and of the value of the plant
cf his company. He declared that he
could not and he did not believe that any
one else can give haj-d and set values for
the corporation's plant. A great deal of
time was consumed in a discussion of the
Market-street reservoir, and when Mayor
Phelan had finished his questions only
one fact of Interest was developed.
This is that the city authorities have
destroyed the property as a reservoir by
cutting streets through it. The business
district which could be supplied from this
reservoir is now supplied therefore by a
reservoir four miles out of town. This
palpably is a menace. What the Market
ttreet property may be worth therefore is
a question which the witness did not at
reir.pt to settle. The Merced property also
proved the theme of a long discussion,
l>ut not one particularly of prorit. The
Mayor wanted to know if the Merced
property could not be populated since it is
ur>t used and the people of San Francisco
must pay interest en its value. The wit
ress insisted that the property could not
by any means be so used, as it would in
jure tne lakes which now supply water to
the city. Such habitation would Inevita
bly pollute the supply. Nor, the witness
continued, could the reservation b<Â» used
as a park except after a very thorough
eewer system had been established.
Entering into a general' discussion of
Spring- Valley values Schussler declared
that in 1>77, when a movement was on
foot to buy the works of the company
for the city, the directors of Spring Val
ley placed a valuation of $13,5'jy,0w upon
their property, as against Jll.lwO.W) as the
estimates made by experts for the city.
Adding to this Jl3.oOo,i>k> t'-.e sum of J15.
hW>Z2j 16, which has been actually ex
pended in construction, the purchase of
water and Â¦ riparian rights and rights
of way between the years of 1577
and IS3?, Inclusive, the witness
insisted that the works of the
Spring Valley Water Company are worth
at least $30.'.Â»00,00Q. Not only is the prop
erty worth this, but the witness contend
Â«-d that it Is of a most substantial char
*cter, economically established and in
every particular necessary. For a verifi
cation of this assertion Mr. Schussler re-
Jerred to Colonel Mendell of the Board of
Public Works.
With this Mr. Schussler was excused
and Colonel Mendell was called to the
Hand by Mayor Phelan. The colonel must
take no Interest in public affairs or he is
certainly a man who does not scare
easily. He probably does not know that
ilayor Phelan still has that surgeon's
knife or he dots not care particularly
whether or not there Is- a vacancy in the
Bsard of- Public Works. Colonel Mendell
proved a far better witness for the Spring
Valley Water Company that did Schuss
ler. The colonel declared that he knows
Absolutely nothing of the present value
of the works of the Spring Valley Water
Company, but he would in fairness place
a vaiui upon it equal to the cost of sup
plying the city with water from another
source. The Mayor had received Just the
answ*r ho did not want. He fared no bet
ter in endeavoring to induce Colenel Men
dell to say that a Sierra supply could be
obtained at the figures suggested by- him
eelf. Colonel Mendell declared that twen
ty-three years ago he believed that $16,-
OiO.OOO would be required to bring water
from the SierraF. but material is now very
much dearer and the system would have
to be duplicated, necessitating a double
cost, or at least $32,000,000, and perhaps
more.
Mayor Phelan attempted also to show
that the findings In the investigation of
the Los Angeles Water Company may be
made to apply to the Spring Valley "Wa
ter company, but Colonel Mendell re
plied that between the two there is abso
lutely no basis for comparison. He agreed
with* Schussler that the Merced property
should not be given over to habitations
or used as a park. After a deal of fur
ther fruitless questioning he was excused.
George E. Booker, chief clerk of the
Spring Valley Water Company, was then
called to the stand. He was questioned
very closely in connection with the accu
sation that his company discriminated
against shipping at this port by exacting
exorbitant rates. He denied the charge
emphatically and furnished several rea
sons to support his denial. Some amuse
ment was furnished during his examina
tion by Supervisor Maguire, who indicat
ed with marked clearness that he had no
reason to suspect what he waa talking
about or why.
Hermann Kchussler, chief engineer of
the Spring Valley Company, took the
stand to continue hU testimony of the
previous meeting concerning the value of
the company's property and the operating
and constructing expanses. Mayor Phe
lan assumed the role cf cross-examiner,
first asking: Mr. Schussler as to the ex
tent of the unoccupied lands of the com
pany in this city and county.
Mr. Schussler said that these lands were
around the Brannon street and the Mar
ket street reservoirs. He was unable to
state the value of the tracts, somo flvo
hundred in number, as they were pur-
Chased years ago and many of them were
under water now. He added that it was a
question whether anybody living could
value them jls they stand.
In answer to another question he re
plied that a portion of the land on the
l^ake Merced watershed had been valued
lor Â¦Government purposes at $1000 an acre.
"Do you consider that' a fair valuation
for that land?" he was asked.
"It is worth all of that," was his reply.
The lake covers about 2000 acres of the
site of 4450 acres, the surrounding land
owned by the company belns about 2450
acres. The Mayor asked If that land was
necessary for the purposes of the com
pany, and Mr. Schussler replied that he
considered it very necessary for the rea
eon that the water percolating through it
went into the lake much purer than would
otherwise be the case.
"I advised the directors of the com
rany," he said, "to forego any rental they
might set from it for pasturage, and they
Hnally decided to do so for that very rea
son."
On this Lake Merced site. Mr. Schussler
testified, the company had built bulkheads
and a drainage canal at a cost of $176,
914 11.
"Did you not construct these improve
ments," asked the Mayor, "for the pur
pose of protecting the lake from the
drainage of the watershed?"
"Yes, sir; from the pollution. Before the
work was constructed the water carried
a grer.t deal of filth from the watershed
into the lake, and I constructed this
drainage system to prevent it. It has
benefited the service a gTeat deal, and
bacteriological examinations show that
the water has improved and is now found
to be excellent."
"What would be the effect, asked the
Mayor, "on the water supply tn Lake
Merced by the abandonment of the 2450
acres for park purposes, for Instance?"
"I do not think it would hurt the water
supply much if the land were used for
park purposes and the people were not
allowed to commit nuisances and if. a
thorough 6ystem of water-tiglit sewers
were laid down there."
"Do you consider it necessary to pre
serve unoccupied that large acreage near
the site of the lake?"
"Yes. sir, absolutely, as long as you
want to use the water for domestic pur
poses, because if you allowed thousands
of people to go there and you didn't have
a thorough system of sewerage you are
very apt to create a source of pollution
to the water."
In answer to other questions by the
Mayor Mr. Schussler stated that he did
not value all of that property at $1000 an
acre. He said that he had stated that
the Government had been asked to pay
that price for a certain number of acres
that It wanted.
"Do you consider it worth more or less
than that?"
"That is hard to say. The lake has
Feen us through trouble from breaks In
our other plants throughout the country
and has helped us very much indeed, and
its location so near the city makes it all
the more valuable."
Mayor Phelan called the attention of
Mr. Schussler to the valuations placed In
IS9O upon the property of the Spring Val
ley Water Company by Colonel Yon
Schmidt and R. J. Dunn, Yon Schmidt's
valuation beine J12.642.000 and Dunn's In
the s=ame neighborhood, and asked him if
he disputed those valuations.
"I do most emphatically," was thÂ©
reply. "They were entirely too low, for
the simple reason that thirteen years be
fore that the city had employed first-class
expert.*, who had examined these works
and compared them with other works, and

Brought From Jail to Testify in the
Price Divorce Case.
MRS. CORDELIA BOTKIN, un
der sentence of life Im
prisonment for the murder
of Mrs. John P. Dun
ning, was an unwilling- wit
ness In Judge Dalngerfleld's
department of the Superior Court
yesterday afternoon, having been
brought In from Branch County Jail
No. 3, where she is confined pending
the Supreme Court's decision of her
appeal for a' new trial, to testify in the
divorce suit of Mrs. Birdie Price vs.
A. G. Price. Mrs. Price charged her
husband, who Is an electrician, with a
statutory offense as a ground for di
vorce, and he responded with a gen
eral denial and a cross-complaint
charging her with similar offenses
asainst law and morals. The allega
tions on both sides are spicy, and the
witnesses thus far examined have
given some Interesting testimony, but
Mrs. Botkin's appearance on the stand
as a witness for the husband Is
fraught with unusual interest be
cause of the fact mat Mrs. Price was
proprietress ! of the Victoria Hotel,
where Mrs. Botkin resided Â¦when she
mailed the poisoned candy that
caused the death of the wife and
sister-in-law of her erstwhile lover
and was one of the chief witnesses
against her.
Eighteen months or more of prison
life have made no Inroads on the phy
sical health of the woman whose trial
was one of the sensations of the year.
In other respects, however, she is
greatly changed. The erect carriage
and air of almost brazen defiance
which characterized her all during the
weary, exciting weeks of that trial
have entirely disappeared. The change
in this respect is remarkable and
somewhat puzzling. The quiet, black
gowned woman with downcast eyes
and subdued voice who stepped on the
platform in response to the summons,
"Mrs. Cordelia Botkin,"- in Judge
Dalngerfleld's court yesterday, was
not the least suggestive of a convicted
murderess, and the very antithesis of
CHANGE WROUGHT IN MRS. BOTKIN SINCE CONVICTION.
