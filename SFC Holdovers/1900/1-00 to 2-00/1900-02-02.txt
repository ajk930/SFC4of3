Some surprise was expressed to-nisrht
that D, M. Burns polled thirty votes on
the first ballot instead of twentv-cieht.
Two of these votes are entitled to an ex
planation. One of them was eiven by
Assemblyman Owen Wade <?f Xaoa and
the. other by Assemblyman A- H. Mer
rill of San Francisco. 'Â¦Â¦ :â¢â¢.''â¢â¢Â¦â¢" -.-'^i;."
..Assemblyman Wade has won and en
joyed a reputation for honesty in pri
vate life and of honor in public station.
During' the regular session h; did not
vote for D. M. Burns, for whom he
Â¦voted to-night. Assemblyman Wade
did; not . dare .to .vote for the Mexican
.then; as he knew that men were bcin?
bought to. support the cause of Burns,
and it; "stings an honest man to be found

ASSEMBLYMAN WADE
THE DISGRACED
CALL HEADQUARTERS,
SACRAMENTO, Feb. I.â lf
the constituents of Assembly
man Owen Wade do not call
upon him ; to resign and come
home.it is because there is no
room left for him in Napa
County. It cannot be doubted
that the vote which to-night
he cast for Dan Burns was dve 1
to no ; mistake of judgment.
Wade is well known for a
sound business man of affairs
who. is not addicted to mis
takes of such magnitude. The
ballot, which he gave to the
Mexican was cast^deliberately
and of his own volition; there
were no instructions from his
home people; there was no reso
lution adopted by the political
body of his county. Wade
went over of his own accord,
and after duly weighing in
the balance against the inevit
able consequences the consid
erations for which he gave his
vote. What those considera
tions may have been, only
Wade can tell. Those who
know him say his ballot to
night was the death knell of
his political aspirations and
chances in Napa County. The
voters of his district are of
the best class and have always
been unanimously and unal
terably opposed to the Mexi
can; it is hardly likely they
will reward hiss by promoting
him to the Senate.
"I have had no instruc
tions," said he to-night a^ter
the balloting. "I went to
Burns because he was the
highest man and we thought
we could elect him, but it
seems now somewhat as
though we were mistaken."
Mr. Wade's excuse for his
vote was ambiguous. What
he meant by Burns being the
"high man" does not appear
unless it was that by his de
falcations the Mexican had
become the highest in the list
of the debtors of the State
which he seeks to represent.
It is more likely, however,
that Wade, in his zeal for the
Mexican's cause, overlooked
that little matter of $31,
738 59 or lost sight of it in
the sheen of something closer
at hand. Poor old disgraced
Wade!
and closed . in an increasing and
swelling boom with nineteen
votes, . only twelve behind the
Mexican, and the second in, the
race. .â¢ Â¦ '.â¢Â¦ Â¦Â¦ â¢ â¢ .'Â¦'â¢ â¢'.-Â¦ ..â¢â¢-â¢â¢ 'Â¦
Â¦ And .how for : the votes given
to the Mexican. For five ballots
he received thirty votes, each
voice snapping its choice with a
ring that could not conceal hu
miliation, but with a force that
showed the bravado of one who
has committed a. contemptible
act, but is nerved to brazen out
the sneering lips and scornful
eyes of those who are not igno
rant of the character of the " act.
Durihg-tnese ballots the scene in
â¢the ; caucus chamber was dra
matic. For five ballots a .Repub-
dates Barham, Barnes, Bulla,
Paterson and Scott played.no im
portant part on the lines of 'pros
pective; success. .Barham and
Paterson opened with two votes
and neither gained nor lost to the
end. . Barnes received nine votes
oh the first ;' ballot; and / gradually
lost until he closed : with three
votes. Bulla began .with three
votes and increased his showing
to eight Votes! and after, a', great
deal of fluctuation ended with
eight votes. \
Grant received the.compliment
of. twenty Votes .on the first bal
lot, but one" by briejthe 'men who

Ifor D. M. Burns now? Perhaps he can
tell best: perhaps" William F. Herrin can
tell better. Mr. Wade has not taken the
public into his -confidence.
He is the cashier of a bank, arid expe
rience has taught him two different at'
tributes of money â it is valuable and
talks. Perhaps Mr. Wade has discovered
that dishonesty in private life and dis
grace in a public trust are the qualifica
tions that win the votes of honest men.
As for Assemblyman A. H. Merrill,
his personality is not a matter for public
concern. He is an insurance agent, and
would violate the simplest principle of
his business if after to-night he would
accept his own character as a risk. If
he were to become serious with him
self for an instant he would see that in
the wreck of his own future he has con
tributed nothing to that of another. . As
Jilson, Simpson and Wright were the
odorous trio of the regular session, so
Merrill, Wade and McDonald will live
in the resentful memory of the people
of CaJifornia as the infamous triumvi
rate of the extra session, who gave all
for a dowry of shame and dishonor.

garded as a desirable candidate and Joneji
haa lived here long enough to know this.
E. P. Fowlerâ Burns is not the man for
Southern California. I hope that the slate
that is fixed will be smashed. Jones should
look to his people for inspiration.
H. Cahen, bankerâ Burns la not the de
sired candidate. All of our legislators
know how our people feel.
L.AII of the persona named voted for Sen
ator Jones at the last election. Ralph
Jones, son of the Senator, in a conversa
tion- to-day, said: "Father last winter
supported Scott, because he was afraid of
Burns. In the family it U understood that
he will not support Burns- and I do not
think he will, because he has never utter
ed a sentiment that would cause us so to
believe."
Information comes from Santa Ana to
night that the sentiment against Jones"
voting against Burns is aa strong there
as here and that McFadden. who was the
political discoverer of Jones, is as mad
as a "March hare" that he has lost control
over his- protege. No . attempt has been
made to build a sentiment- against Jones.
This is simply a reflection of the sentiment
as it actually exists.

would go further to-night than mere or

of his strength at. thirty-five; including

but he may . be. merciful . at last and not
expose them to. the merciless criticism of
an insulted and outraged commonwealth.

as a sure omen ot the speedy elimination

ThÂ« second stunning blow . which the
touts received from the organized stal
warts came when the Â¦.'motion .was sprung
to adjourn, the caucus -until to-morrow
night. Burns had counted on adjournrrient
untii next Monday evening. lie had plan
ned for midnight conferences between the
emissaries of the Southern Pacific and
weak-minded members of. the. Legislature.
Doubtless orgies to debauch. and- corrupt
the unresisting were in view, but the tac
tics of Infamy were checkmated by the
prompt and resolute action of the states
men who mean to save this faJr State of
California from a lasting shame. : "
When the caucus adjourned to-night, the
stalwart Republicans were cheerful and
confident. On the other side the forces
of the Mexican were disheartened and de
jected. The latter hold, however, one last
lingering hope, and that is the hope of
receiving aid and comfort from the mem
bers who are voting for U. S. Grant, In
the face of the announcement made l>y
Grant himself, that he does not favor the
election of Burns, the Mexican insists that
he Is Grant's choice. A grosser falsehood
was never uttered to deceive honest men
and gain political favor. Grant's name Is
being used by the odious touts to prolong
the life of the Mexican.

the sum of $40,000. In explanation of his
motion Brown said that there was. noth
ing .to Indicate that the present session
would ' not extend over a longer â¢ period

and Dibble objected, and explained the
basis from which the bills had been cal

he was- in favor of the amendment, and
that the bill as read carried the argument
that the Assembly could not be trusted to
do its duty by the people and itself. . Le

Senator Flint called the caucus to order

rooms. An adjournment was taken to the
Assembly chambers, where there was
more room to make the colonel's slaugh

Before the caucus was organized. Grove
Joh::son, representing the Burns people,
pleaded with the anti-Burns contingent
to allow the Mexican to have one of the
becretarles, -claiming that they had no
desire to make a fight on the selection of
the officers. Notwithstanding, that the
Burns men were hopelessly out of it, the
other side magnanimously allowed them
to put in Leavitt.
Immediately after Flint called the cau
cus to order Belshaw moved that he be
elected chairman. Grove Johnson second
ed the nomination, and Flint's election
vas unanimous. On motion of Bulla,
Knowland. Cutter and Leavitt were elect
t-d secretaries, and on the motion of Val

ut-arms. * Â¦ ' ,Â¦Â¦ :- ;Â¦ Â¦ . ' Â¦

When the anti-Burns forces moved to
proceed with the balloting. Grove John

the Mexican's men to catch their breath.
* # We should abide by the result of. the

authority. .
The second Instance promised for a time
to have serious consequences and trouble
may yet arise xrom 1t... Governor Taylor
issued a pardon to Douglas Hayes; a con
vict in the Frankfort penitentiary, who is
serving a five years' term. for manslaugh
ter, having been sentenced in March, 1599. :
When the pardon was pent to Warden Lil-j
lard he uecided that he could not turn-the
man loose until he was satisfied regarding',
the legal status of the Governorship-. -"He
made no reply to-Goyernor Taylor, but de
clined to honor the pardon and. informed
the Penitentiary Commisslonres .of ' .his
action. They agreed with the' position
taken by the .-Warden and the man- was
held. Â¦ ' :.:--. -v . â¢Â¦ : â¢ v .'\. Â¦Â¦
The action 1 of : Mr. Lillard, who is ah
ardent supporter of GOebel. aroused'ln
tense indignation among: the Republicans'
and it was declared that a detaenment of
soldiers would be-se'ht to the Penitentiary
.to take the man away by force if Warden
Lillard persisted In his refusal to'rHoasc-
Hayes. No such talk, however, came from
the office of Governor Taylor or that, of
Adjutant General Collier. : This talk' was
naturally resented by ' the Democrats.; as
Mr. Lillard received open offers of aid in
Â¦case he snould decide' t<> t-ngage in a bat^
tie with the soldiers over their rights to
enter the jail and take Hayes out. When;
this afternoon. , his office was visited, the
Warden was engaged in conversation over
the telephone. He was giving the man
at the other end of the wire information
regarding the number of men he could'
provide to resist a -possible- attack. He
rung off as several- visitors entered his :
office and discontinued :the conversation,
declining to disclose the identity of Â¦â¢he
man at the other end cf the wife, who
was evidently asking him if he desired
assistance. â¢
*'I can do nothing more or less than hold
the man," said the W.-irden. "The situ
ation is known to everybody, and I can
not assume the responsibility of releasing
men on the order of Mr. Taylor when thfe
Legislature has declared specifically that
Mr. Goebel is the Governor of the State.
Had the pardon been received yesterday 1
would have let the man go and been glad
to do so.' I wish to keep no man in this
place, but I cannot release convicts on
the order of a man who, it has been de
clared by the law-making power of tho
State, has no right to issue such orders."
When asked if he intended to offer re
sistance to a detachment of troops if one
should be sent to release Hayes, the War
den replied:
"Oh, no. It would not do for me to at
tempt any such. thing as that. I have
fourteen guards only, and they could not
do much against soldiers."
When asked if he did not know where
he could obtain plenty of help if he neea
ed it. the Warden said: ;
"When the soldiers come up here arid
demand the keys for the purpose of tak
ing out Hayes, I think they are likely to
get them. If convicts are taken out of
here in that manner, the responsibility
will rest on the men who take him awas-.
and not upon me."
No answer was returned to Governor
Taylor either by Warden Lillard or the
Board of Penitentiary Commissioners. His
letter was quietly ignored. It is possible
that a reply will be made to it to-morrow,
but it is not likely.
It is now definitely decided that General
John B. Castleman of Louisville Is not
to be adjutant general to Goebel, and
while it was asserted last night with great
posltiveness that he had been appointed,
it is said to-night that he was never ten
dered the place. No man has been ap
pointed as yet, but the name of Colonel
T. J. Smith of the Third Kentucky Infan
try is prominently mentioned.
No attention whatever has been paid by
the militia to Governor Goebel'-* order to
return to their homes. It is just as though
the order had never been issued. Adju
tant General Collier says that no consider
ation will be given to any orders that may
emanate from the Goebel headquarters.
The Legislature is making progresa.
Yesterday it was hustled around the town
and raced through the streets by the
military. This morning a small portion of
it was turned back at . the gate of the
State House grounds, when an attempt
was made to reach the Capitol building.
This afternoon it reached the door of the
building, and as a body it has strong
hopes that the next attempt will take
them into the legislative chambers. At 4
o'clock this afternoon printed notices were
handed around the lobby of the\ Capitol
Hotel, signed by Speaker Trimble, asking
all members of the Legislature to meet at
tho west door of the hotel at 5 o'clock,
preparatory to holding a session in thte
Capitol building. It was generally under
stood that admission would be refused,
but the Democrats determined to demand
access to the building as a matter of form
and to put the Republicans upon record.
At the appointed time the members fell
Into line and in columns of two, headed by
the tall form of Speaker . Trimble, the
march was taken up toward the State
House ground. On both sides and In the
rear came a large crowd. , As Sneaker
Trimble approached the gate, which was
guarded by two sentries, tho soldiers step
ped back, lowered their bayonets, and al
lowed the Speaker to pass through.
"Are you a member of the Legislature?"
asked one of the sentries. _,Â¦ -
â¢ "I am." replied the Speaker as he start
ed up the brick walk' toward the Capitol.
The same question was put to the other
members. as they. appeared and when it
came the turn of the crowd the sentries
fired the same query at every bunch and
every bunch answered In chorus "I am."
The Legislature numbered 500 by the time
the Speaker was at the Capitol steps.

of the situation in Kentucky:
"It surprises no one in Kentucky. It is
a logical consequence of a campaign of
corruption and debauchery. In a word,
from first to last the Democrats have hail

FRANKFORT. Ky.. Feb. I.â For the
first .time since the shooting of Governor
Goebel there were to-day signs. of a peace
able settlement. The signs were few and
fmall and they have disappeared, but the
hole into which they were withdrawn has
been left open and there is a chance that
they may reappear. The original propo
sition looking toward an amicable adjust
ment came from the Republican side just
before noon when T. L. Edelen of Frank
fort, one of Governor Taylor's attorneys,
appeared at the Capitol Hotel to hold a
conference with Judge Pryor, Lewis Mc-
Quown. and Colonel William Scott, the
legal advisers of the Democrats. After
a short talk Mr. Edelen declared that
Governor Taylor and the Republican
party were anxious to avoid anything that
might possibly lead to serious tronÃle. as
the present conditions might do jt noth
ing was done to prevent it. He was as
sured by the Democratic attorneys that
they were as anxious to save any clash,
between the parties" as the Republicans
could be. Mr. Edelen then proposed to
6abmit the case of the rival Governors
to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which,
he declared. Judging by the action of
Judge Hazelrlgg in swearing in Governor
Goebel. would probably decide against
Governor Taylor. He then wanted the
right to submit the matter to the United
States Supreme Court for final settlement.
The talk Â«v informal. Mr. Edelen merely
stating his position that the opposing at
torneyÂ« might take the matter under ad
visement- The lawyers separated with an
agreement to meet again at 2 o'clock in
the afternoon.
"When they met for the second time Mr.
Edt-lea again submitted his proposition
and received the reply- that the Demo
cratic attorneys desired to have the mat
ter adjusted in the State courts. To this
Mr. Edelen objected, eaylng he wished the
final settlement to be made in the Su
premÂ© Court at Washington. Mr. Edelen
cfked for details regarding the seating of
Governor Goebel by the joint session last
nlgbu As it has been repeatedly an
nounced that the Republicans would
claim that the seating of a Governor by
joint bailot Is contrary to the Goebel elec
tion law of Kentucky, which provides,
ihe Republicans claim, that the vote shall
be taken separately, the Democrats de
clined to say anything about the meeting.
They told Mr. Edelen that the proceedings
of the session were written in the journal
of legislative proceedings and that he
voula there find all the information which
It was possible to give him.
Mr. McQuown urged the Republicans to
concede the election and seating of Gov
ernor Goebel. which Mr. Edelen declined
to entertain. Both sides at the end
of their respective ropes. Nothing more
could be paid on either side and the law
jers separated. A.s they left the room Mr.
Edelen intimated that it was possible that
lie might be able to submit another propo
eitiuii at some later time. He was given
to understand that he would be met half
way and the conference was at an end.
Two direct slaps ,c were given Governor
Taylor to-day by public officers, who de
clined to obey his orders. The iirst came
from President Rodman of the Farmers'
Bar.k. which is a State depository. . .Some
vouchers on the bank were signed by; Go
vernor Taylor in favor of some of the mili
tia officers, who wanted money for their
companies. When, they were^presented at

Rodman said that he did not see how he

BULLER STILL NEEDS
HEAVY REINFORCEMENTS
LONDON*. Feb. 2.â Spencer : Wilkinson,:
In the Morning Post .to-day, discusses a
long dispatch from 'Â¦.Winston: Churchill/
dated at Pietermaritzburg, and describing
the situation in Natal. He says: ...;,.
This dispatch deserves to be closely .read. .It
is an appeal to the public at home, and: as it
has boen paired by- the censor, may be taken
to reprw^nt the feelings of General. Buller' S
army. Mr. Churchill represents the difficulties
cf General Buller's task in concise terms.
The enemy will act with common sense. They
will p'.ace outjK.sts on the hills and keep back
their train bwiy until they see the direction cf
General liuller's movement. Then they will
qulcklv bring up the main body and extempor
ise what deft-nslve works they can. In addi
tion to *nch as they have profusely prepared In
anticipation of various jjosslble advances.
That Is what every one would expect them to
<30. and that their main body can ride faster
than G'-riTal Buller' 6 main body can waJk was
also pretty generally understood. The conse
quence ir that the Bo*r army cannot be turned
Wherever it is attacked It can present an ln
trenchÂ«"d front. Â¦
According to Mr. . Churchill there are 7000
Boer* watching I^adyrmlth. the ea-me number
held T> a.dy to reslft Oeneral Buller and 5000
kept in r*>sÂ«frve to reinforce either body at
r<eed. Thun Oenfral Buller has to attack 12 000
Â«^itrenched on favorable ground. For that pur
rose Mr. Churchii! thinks he ought to have

LEYDS TRYING TO
INDUCE INTERVENTION
BERLIN, Feb. I.â lt is strongly rumored
in parliamentary circles that the chief
political object of Dr. Leyds in visiting
Parts, Berlin and St. Petersburg is to in
duce France. Germany and Russia to in
tervene if Great Britain should attempt
to seize Delagoa Bay. â¢â¢.:Â¦â¢Â¦.' :Â¦ Â¦â¢ Â¦ :Â¦.--Â¦..Â¦
The correspondent of. the /Associated
Press learns that Count vori.- Bulow, the :
Foreign Secretary, has thus far refused
to give a definite promise. '.There have
been daily conferences between the Em
peror and Count. yon Bulow on the sub
ject. German colonial circles and the Gov
ernment itself regard the war as distinct
ly unfavorable to Germany's interests in
Africa. No matter how it may end Ger
many will acquire uncomfortable neigh
bors â either "fanatical Boers" Â¦or "pre-
Eumptuous British." Â¦Â¦' ' . .. Â¦', Â¦ .-.
More than this the feeling is that in
German Southwest Africa, where the
Boer element is strong but slumberingt a
formidable Boer movement is bound to
be awakened. Germany, therefore, would
like peace under conditions that would
leave both belligerents weakened. .'
General yon Schwelling in the'lokai
Anzeiger says: "The Boers will and must
continue, the fisht until the military bank
ruptcy of the English is accomplished."
PERSONAL SAFETY WAS
MACRUM'S FIRST CARE
LONDON, Feb. Lâ Canon . Farmer, who
was forced to leave Pretoria with other
British clergymen, has arrived in Lon
don. With reference to Charles" E. Ma
crum, the former United States Consul at
Pretoria. Canon Farmer said to a repre
sentative of the Associated Press:.
"Mr. Macmm was one of the last men I
saw before leaving. I told him he was
taking the wrong side, and. did not
understand American feeling. His chief
care seemed to be for his personal safety
and I think it was chiefly on that ac
count that he left in the midst of the
crisis. He is not a strong man and Presi
dent Kruger may have taken advantage
of this. -But when I last saw Mr. Macrum
he was a patriotic and loyal" American.
"In regard to ' Blake's so-called volun
teers they are like Mr. Blakeâ mostly
burghers, who would have been obliged
to fight anyway/ Mr. Macrum told me
there were 5000 Americans In the Trans-

Changes Among the Harbor Hospital
Staff â Captain Alexander Takes
the Pomona â Sunol and Vigi
lant in Collision.
?- . .
There was no material change in the
quarantine situation yesterday. The bark
Martha Davis was added to the list of
vessels anchored off Angel Island, while
after sundown the steamer Nippon Maru
was released and went to the Pacific Mail
Company's tvharf. The latter vessel
Â¦ brought no passengers and no freight
;from Honolulu, so the quarantine- on her
was not as rigorous as It was on the other
vessels. . The Martha Davis comes direct
from the plague-infected district, so she
Â¦Will be held until everything aboard has
been thoroughly fumigated and every rat
on board killed by the disinfecting fluid.
â¢ There is no change In the . quarantine
on the Australia. The passengers are still
on the mall: steamer and there Is no tell
ing when they will be landed. Dr. Kln
,youn is doing everything In his power to
expedite matters, and the ? chances' are
that something will he done this morning.
While in the harbor at Honolulu not a
member of the crew was allowed ashore
and not a soul, pave those who had been
ten days In quarantine whs allowed to
communicate with the vessel. The pas
sengers, who came up on the Australia
had been quarantined in their homes for
ten.days before they were allowed a pass
port.- and no precaution to. prevent the
â¢p!agu# . leaving: Honolulu on the mall
Â«te*tnex was overlooked. In consequence
the^ft/was hot a case of sickness on the
vessel tlurlng the voyage and she reached
port, with a cleun. bill of health.
But' Dr. Klnyoun ts taking no chances,
and.4n consequence the Australia and her
passengers are still in quarantine. Should
tb'e .mail steamer be held the Oceanic
Steamship Company r will .have no diffi
culty in. keeping its <Â¦ contracts, and no
matter what comes "or. goes a steamer
Â¦will, sail for Honolulu next Wednesday.
The- ex-transport Zealandia is now at the
Pacinc-stivet wharf, ready to sail at a
moment's notice. She is a sister ship to
the Australia, and since being released by
the Government has been thoroughly
overhauled and put In the very best or
der for general passenger service. Should
it be impossible to get the Australia ready
In. time the Zealandla will go out next
Wednesday. .â¢; â¢

FARNHAM MAKES A POINT.
Attorneys for John Farnhara,- who is
contesting the election of Patrick Boland
for the office of Public Administrator
made a unique point during the progress
of the case yesterday, the outcome of
which Is doubtful. At the hour for be
ginning the recpunt of ballots the attor
neys failed to call for the same, but plac
ed a motion before the court asking leave
to amend their complaint to enable them
to withdraw their allegation that fraud
and misconduct were committed by the
election officers in the precincts the bal
lots of which have not been counted in the
contest. All of the Democratic precincts
have been counted and Farnham gained
sixty-five votes.- The precincts remaining
uncounted all give Farnham a big ma
jority and as the court allowed the mo
tion to amend and accept the Registrar's
figures on the uncounted precincts he
will win. in event the Supreme Court sus
tains the ruling of the lower court The
matter will be taken up again this mom
ing and whether or not the burden of
proving his claim is thrown on Boland's
shoulders remains to be seen. â¢

TATHAM DENIES
ELOPEMENT STORY
Says Oatie Wathen Was
Seeking Employment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, Feb. I.â W. C. Tatham and
Oatie Wathen, an alleged eloping couple
from Covelo, Mendoclno County, last Sun
day, arrived at Willow's on horseback thl3
afternoon at about 4 o'clock and registered
at the Crawford. A representative of The
Call Interviewed Tatham Immediately
after their arrival. Tatham gave the fol
lowing account of the affair:
"I tell you this story about our eloping
is a He. We had no intention whatever of
marrying. I am 53 years old and Oatie is
1!>. I have known her ever since she was
a baby and treat her like I would a daugh
ter. Oatie has not been living at home fpr
the past year, as her mother married a
second time and Oatie could not get along
with her stepfather. I have a sister. Mry.
McClellan. who resides near Newville,
this county, about fifty miles from Covelo.
1 told Oatie I was going to visit my sta
ter. She asked me if she could go with
me, and I told her she could. She said
she wanted to get work somewhere in
Glenn County, and Sunday afternoon we
saddled our horses and rode out to Lov
ell's place ten miles from Covelo. Next
day we came over the- mountain to my
sister's place at Newville. She stayed
there until to-day, when she heard of a
vacancy in the Fruto Hotel and came to
Fruto this morning. Mr. Squires, the pro
prietor of the hotel, engaged Oatie. Oatie
has never seen Willows and wanted to
come down, so I brought her. She will to
to Fruto to commence work on Sunday.
That is the whole of the affair." _.
Speaking of the journey he said: "The
ride over the mpuntain was terrible. The
snow was twenty feet deep and not very
hard Several times pur horses would
sink down, and we could hardly get them
out. Fpr a time It looked like we would
be frozen to death." ' â¢ .
Miss Watnen substantially corroborated
the statements pf Tatham. and In addition
she said' "For the last year I have been
away from home, living with the family
of John Brown, about twenty miles from
Covelo I did not tell the folks I was cf.m
lng to 'Glenn County, as I did not think
It was their business, as I am of age. I
am not sure I will go to Fruto to work. I
will look around here tlrst.
Both seemed to be in a jolly mood, and
talked without any seeming embarrass
ment The couple created quite a sensa
tion when they came riding Into town on
two bay horses. Miss Wathen was dressed
in bloomers and legglns. with a Hour Back
full of clothes tied behind the saddle. Tat
ham wore the overalls and blue flauntl
Â«Â»hirt of a tvplcal mountaineer.
Mr Squires, when asked If Tatham and
the young lady had been In Fruto looking
for a position, replled^that he had em
ployed the girl in his hotel and said she
was to begin work on Sunday.

ODD FELLOWS' HALL last nipht
was a scene of splendor that has
seldom been surpassed, for it was
most beautifully decorated In white,
canary and gold and red. white and
blue draped In graceful festoons
from ceiling to floor and along the gallery
rail, while the central portion overhead
Â¦was a tasteful arrangement of garlands,
flowers and ferns. The stage was a mass
of living plants and palms, which con
cealed from view an orchestra, and from
the sides there hung in graceful folds the
American flag and that of California Com
mandery No. 1 of the Knights Templar.
The occasion of this magnificent display
was the grand ball given by that eon'
mandery In celebration of its forty-sixth
anniversary. The assemblage of ladies
and gallant Knights was a most brilliant
one and was made up of many of tne
most prominent members of the Masonic
fraternity of this city. The majority of
the ladies wore elegant full dress cos
tumes, while the Knights were in lull
evening dress, and 'the grand march, in
which there were about 200 couples, led by
Commander Sir Knight John Tonnlngscn
and Mrs. Tonningsen, was one that h-is
seldom been excelled in brilliancy in a
ballroom. ;*â¢*'' ''-i
There was a programme of eighteen
dances, well arranged, and dancing was
kept up until 11 o'clock, when there was
the march, under direction of. Floor Di
rector Captain George W. Wittman. to the
banquet nail, on tne lower tloor. where
supper wae served to 41"0. The orchestra
lurnished sweet music while those at the
tables were discussing the toothsome
dishes set before them. â¢ < â..,_.

DEFEND CALIFORNIA.
II N T Washington two incidents have occurred recently
which affect the AVest One is the wide exploita
tion of the Roberts affair, and the other is the in
vestigation of the election of Mr. Clark to the Senate
from Montana. California should studiously/avoid
joining the too much distinguished company, that has
somewhat heretofore illustrated the undesirable and
the repulsive in the public life of some Western com
munities. We should not confess to the world that
our estimate of the United States Senate measures
ithat body down to the intellectual and moral stature
I of Dan ' Burns. We should not gi\-e noticeto the Re
j publican party of other States that he is the full fio\ver
ar.d final result of California Republicanism. No man
denies that his election would be a serious handicap

Sumner the Scholar and Jurist.
Â¦ Little -need be said of: Sumner*B early
llfe> rÃorn, In Boston. January he
became a j graduate" of- Harvard '.. In IS$).
Like : Motley, he ; enjoyed early "affluence
and , advantages/ and- succeeded in spite
of -thenii In 1^31; he entered" the Harvard
law school;: where he studied, under the
renowned Judge : Joseph Story. He con
tinued for several years to apply himself
to study in classroom, office and library,
bringing : to his books a. marvelous mem
ory and ejctraordlnai*}- intellectual indus
try. He spent the years from 1537 to IS4O
abroad, as a stiident and observer, In
London, Paris, Rome. Berlin and other
European centers, becoming acquainted
with the leading, public men* of Europe.
His studies and taste led him toward pol
itics and the law,- His legal studies were
hot such as would develop : . the shrewd
practitioner at the bar; for as his eulo
gist, -.. George William : Curtis*, afterward
said of him, "He was not formed for a
jury lawyer where the jury was less than
a nation or mankind," and. In sporting
language, "though he had a fine eye. for
country, he iiad a poor scent for the
trail." .His tastes drew him rather to
public and constitutional law-^the law of
peace;, and : war and of nationsâ and in
these he .'had -a'; preparation: that stood
him in good stead in the years to come.
In these ten years of study and travel
and reflection we find developing Sumner
the scholarâa scholar whose attainments
were admirably ; : manifested In his first
Indiana University
in the fact that in his constltulonal argu
ment against the fugitive slave, bill: he
fell: back on the compact theory of tha
constitution in. that he held that the fugi
tive slave clause of that document was
not a power-conferring clause, but merely
a compact agreement among the State**
Its enforcement must be left to State coi.l-

slavery In the States. Our political aims as
well as our polltlca! duties are coextensive only
with our political, responsibilities.' "-. Â¦ .-..â¢ ?â¢
Such -was the message that Sumner
gave the Senate ar.d: the nation in ISS2.
and such- was his constant uncompromis
ing platform in the great anti-slavery
conflict.. :Â¦Â¦ :Â¦ Â¦'.â¢Â¦." Â¦:\'----'-\: .Â¦Â¦Â¦ -' : .--. ..- :;. Â¦ .'v
Sumner's Inflexible and Uncompro-
raising Character.
In 1554 Sumner made a plea against the
Douglas repeal of the Missouri compro
mise, calling the repealing bill "at tha
same- time the worst and the best bill in
the annals of Congress." for while it
broke- down an historic barrier against
slavery it at the same time placed the
great antagonists. Freedom and Slav
ery./ face to face and bade them grapple.
He was denounced and buffeted and bad
gered In the Senate as a fanatic, a traitor
and a perjured violator of his oath, on
account of his public utterance against
returning the fugitive slave. "Is thy ser
vant a dog." he answered in the words
Â©f. the prophet, "that he should do this
thing?" Against his astsailants, Butler of
South Carolina. Mason -of Virginia. Doug
las of Illinois. Pettlt of Indiana and
others, he defended the principles of the
Declaration of. Independence, and facing,
as Jackson faced, an adverse Supreme
Court decision, he quoted JuCkson and
Buchanan as good Democratic authority
for the position that when. a. public ofn
cial swears to support the constitution he
Swears to support it as he understands
it, not as it Is understood by others.
On May 19. 1336. Sumner delivered his
celebrated speech In the Senate on "The
Crime Against Kan
sasj' the speech for
which he was as
saulted by Brooks.
Bumner's speeches
were very offensive
to. his opponents.
When he assailed
slavery its advo
rates felt themselves
to be personally in
sulted. The passage
in this speech to
which exception was
taken was certainly
In bad taste, and it
shows . personal of
fensiveness, if not
coarseness. Mr.
Rhodes, the histo
rian of the period,
finds no apology for
Sumner's per sonn.l :
attack on Senator
Bailer. But Sumner
did not. transgress
the bounds of par
liamentary decorum,
and he was not
called to order by.
the president of the
Senate or by any
Â¦ Senator. In Sumner
the uncompromising
Southerner met ag

of . It -did. not come Â¦ within
the domain of expediency. "To be wrong
On this . Is to be wholly wrong. On thia

: crisis Â¦' Sumner was appealed to .tor vota
for the Crittenden compromise and save
the country from. -war, he answered: "I
mvst. do. my 'duty; I can vote.for no con
cession to human: slavery." In this ha
spoke. ..more as the morai reformer than
as the statesman, more like, one who has

â¢* In other ! phases of Sumner's public
career he filled an important place in tho
history of his country. But these, in the
story of his life, will always be subordi
nate to his career as an Â¦ anti-slavery ad
i^vtjcate and. statesman. From 13K1 to 1572
â¢ he was chairman of the. Senate Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs, and In thai posi
tion, so entirely In accord with his tastes,
he contributed materially to the literature
of international law. His great speech on
the "Trent Affair," Januafy 9. li&i. ts one
of his*- ablest productions; i and ft placed
the of Mason and SUdell on
the most acceptable groundâ on grourtd
.sounder and more tenable than that, as
sumed by Secretary Seward. That thÂ©
country was ready to acquiesce in- the
surrender of the Confederate envoys, it
has been said, was duo to Sumner, who
made It clear that the. action was in ac
cordance with principles always main
tained by the United States and. ln ac
cordance with our humane and peaceful
traditions of neutrality. â¢"'-.'
The war over. Sumner spoke far concil
iation and amnesty. He harbored no re
sentment or revenge. But he never wav
ered in his devotion to the cause of equal
civil and political rights for all men. re
! gardies* of race, color or previous condi
tion of servitude, and when he died. In 1574.
it may be said that the struggle for tha
protection by national power of tha
Southern freedmen In their civil and polit
ical.privileges came to an end.
To Sumner's mind politics was an en
nobling pursuit. His life forcibly illus
trated hi.-* maxim that "politics is- but t ha
jtppllcation of moral principles to publta
affairs." He brought to his political Ufa
profound conviction, supreme conscien
tiousness, great resources, careful train
ing, unselfish, devotion to the public weal
and the indomitable martyr spirit of the
reformer. In times like these it is well
that- the American people should turn to
the contemplation of such a life. â¢

ceived with hearty applause.
The lecture was the first of a series and
took place under the auspices of the So
ciety for the Prevention or Cruelty to Ani
mals. Secretary Charles Holbrook and
wife were present, and Mrs. Holbrook in
troduced the speaker, with the statement
that he was "in the forefront of those la
boring in the cause of humanity." . Presi
dent-Jordan treated his theme purely
from a scientific standpoint, in introduc
tion beginning with tbe single cell and the
protoplasm which It contains, and gradu
ally ascending to a discussion of the high
er types of animal life.
He differentiated the sensations of warm
and cold blooded animals, saying that in
some cases a trout had. been thrown back
into ; the water after a hook had bet>n
baited with one of its eyes, when the fi*h
would return and nibble at its own 'eye.
Nothing similar to this could ever occur
in' the case of a warm-blooded animal, he
Bald, though some men were so impracti
cal and so constituted by. nature that they
played the nickel-in-the-slot machines.
Reaching the broad subject of marrs
inhumanity to man, he said he hoped the
day would arriveâ though it might be a
few thousand years hence â when "nig
gerÃ" and Chinese, and Indians and Boers
would all be regarded as possessing simis
and entitled to the right to live. This
ironical. thrust at Great Britain, as well
as- the reference to the way In which the
speaker conceived that country as regard
ing her opponents," resulted in long-contin
ued applause.. Â¦ â¢ â¢
"The greatest crime in the world;" he
continued. "Is the crime of war. The
greatest imposition rs man's servitude to
the state, which makes it obligatory upon
him to go out and kill his fellow-man. It
war is not wrong, then nothing is wrong.
The redcoat is symbolic of war.' and It is
this same redcoat bully that is hindering
the march of man." ..-.Â¦â¢

Sumner: :.-..the Free: Soiler.
But of greater interest is Sumner /the
anti-slavery Senator and moral reformer.
The inspiration, of .Sumner's early public
career Is found in : the -cause of free sojl-
He became interested very early, in .the
antl-slavery : movement.'. Â¦ He was" a '.sub
scriber to the Liberator in its early, year?',
and he wasa friend of Garrison. Phillips
and Charinihg.- In 1841 he .criticized ..Web-.
ster's correspondence Irt the. "Creole case
as giving Unnecessarily national support
and countenance to;the\slave interest. He :
denounced the admission. : of Texas, arid
he held the with Mexico to be .."un
constitutional In origin.- unjust In charr
acter and detestable Mn object;", ana,
above. all', he held that if additional ter
ritory be forced Up^fr: us "from all such
territory slavery should- be forever . ex
cluded." At the coriÂ«?luÂ«Â«loi> of the Mexi
can war. with the. iprnspect before" us: of
slavery extension-- toward the- South' and
r Sumrier felt.that the time had come
when men -of all .parties shoulit unite
against, slavery." Â¦Â¦' In- politics- he was. a
Whig. Put he understood, that a party
was a means, hot- in- end; and If his party
.would "not serve hia purpose .he would find
an organization that; would. â¢ ..- . T
Euxnner and the^Fugitive Slave lAw.
On : November $;; IS.V)! In Faneull. Hall,
soon after the passage of ; the. fugitive
slave law of that year^. Sumner. jspoke. on
"Our Immediate. Anti-Slavery . Duties'."
This was a remarkable speech: He de
nounced the fugitive slave law arid; delib
erately, counseled resistance. â¢Â¦' Â¦
'Â¦"I will hot,", he said;- "dishonor this home of
the Pilgrims ami of the Revolution, by. admitting
ânay. 1 cannot believeâ that this btll will be
executed here.: Among us. as elsewhere, indi
viduals may forget humanity In fancied loyalty
to law, but the public conscience will not allow
a man who has trodden our streets as a free
man to be dragged away as a slave."
This is the speech that is said to have
made Sumner Senator. It sounded the key
note for the Free Sellers of America in
the face of the "finality" legislation and
compromise of ISSO. The speech was de
nounced as treasonable by Southern men
and apologists for slavery, and it is cer
tain that more than anything else it de
termined Sumner's selection by the Free
Soil party as Its candidate for the Sen
ate. In the election of 1850 there wa3 a
coalition In Massachusetts between the
Free Sollers and the Democrats In the
choice "of State Senators and Representa
tives, with the understanding that cue
State officers chosen by the Legislature
should be Democrats and the United
States Senator a\Free Soiler. Sumner
was chosen Senator in April, IS3I. after a
long contest.
"He was not a member of either of the prÂ«it
parties. H<> was pledged th'nl and always and
only, to his *enÂ»e of right. He stoctl for no
partisan end whatever, but simply and. .solely
for' uncompromising resistance to- slavery."â
Curtis. ...
In the Senate it was with difficulty that
Sumner found ah' opportunity to Â«*pcak
upon his "one idea." It was not until
August 26, 1552. that by a parliamentary
maneuver he gained his chance. He then
made his celebrated speech for the r^pcil
of the fugitive slave law.. This Is recog
nized as the masterpiece among Sumner ".Â«*
anti-slavery .orations. Mr. Curtis pro
nounces it "the most significant event in
the Senate" since Webster's reply to
Hayne. and an epitome of Sumner's "whole
career." In 'maintaining, his fundamental
thesis â "that." irce<lom was national and
slavery was sectional"â Sumner held that
wherever there -was national power there
was national responsibility," and that thi*
responsibility could not be discharged un
less that power were used -in restraint of
â¢ slavery,. Therefore he demanded tbeM.i
stant repeal of the fugitive slave bill, the
abolition of slavery in the District of Co
lumbia, that Congress should prohibit
slavery In the Territories.- that the di
mestlc slave" trade be restrained, espe
cially on the high seas under the national
flag, and that the "National Government
should go- to the limit of Its constitutional
power to relieve Itself from all responsi
bility for slavery. This was. substantial
ly, the Free' Soil platform. The conserva

fused to appoint an inspector, is'ow these

The rase with which the active specialties re
sponded to the: pool buying caused many of the
active traderp to transfer their efforts to raise
prices from tiie railroads Into . the metal . group,
where the prospective- profit- seemed alluring.:
In connection with the monetary situation call
and time money rates were: easy, but bids for
large Â¦ amounts of the latter were made below
the market, which holds at. 4 per cent. London
operations, . while not extensive, were: on the
long side, with purchases influenced by rumors
that General Buller's forces had recrossed the
Tucela Rlver^ There was no change in the
Bank of England's rate of discount to-day, and
an analysis of the weekly statement of that in
stitution and the Bank of France promises con
tinued ease! in the foreign monetary situation. .
A good demand developed for. the active bond

New; York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, Feb. 1- While a good deal of
Irregularity was rr.anifest in to-day's market,
en account of the important operations for both
accounts in leading properties, the bulls at all
times held the mastery, as evidenced by the
generous sprinkling of net calns through the
list. Influences contributing to this result in
cluded a heavy absorption of the Iron and steel
cto<ks and the excellent net statements of the
leading lines. Efforts to dampen bullish en
thusiasm met with temporary success at Inter
vals through ajrgreffcive hammering of the local
croup: A ragged opening was due primarily to
the unsettling incMent in sugar yesterday and
yielding prices for Americans in London. It
was soon made .manifest that an important
tnciv< nient was carded In the metal croup, as
Jfpui-r whirh are usually not factors livened up
tn.J advanced rapiiiy. Strength developed in
Otter stocks and the market rose easily. Toe
lÂ«>ar fartion made a concerted attack on the
local utilities and broke Third Avenue nine
joints. Â¦Â¦ Kindred properties . (tagged 1 to 3^4
points and fiugar and Tobacco were also large
ly aCerted. This maneuver provoked selling of
therailroad Mocks, but as the various encour
acJr.g traffic statements came to hand the offer
ings diminished and Interest centered almost
wholly" in the transactions. 'The demoralization
in Third Avenue induced an official statement
by the oounwl' of; the company of a plan to
finance Its indebtedness by an Issue of 6 per
cent nntes, allowing optional redemption by the
company within a year. The notes do not con
tain any tUuse j*>rmiu:ng the convertibility
into stock. â¢ This statement effectually disposed
of recent rumors that the Issue woujd be $20 -
Â«Â«.000 and would jeopardize dividend payments
on the stock- Supporting orders rallied It three
points, but it went down lower than before in
a drive near the rlose and ended with a net
JnsÂ»,.of c-iÃht iKiints. A variety of rumors were
circulated in connection with the buoyancy of
the iron and Kteel etocks," among which was the
early establishment of Tennessee Coal and Iron
common stock on an & per cent dividend hails.
Other advices 'were predictions as to the enor
mous f-arnings of the .various companies and
trade reports asserting a distinct Improvement
in thÂ« industry. Tennessee Coal did not develop
Us buoyancy until numerous other issues of thU
das* had beer, advanced smartly. When the
move in it -started It quickly assumed pre-emi
nence and rose nine points, despite enormous
realizations. Gains in c other,, members of . the
croup were let* pronounced, but ranged from
2 to 3H i>er cent. The early attempts of the
bear* to create liquidation In the standard
Ftooks proving unavailing:, the shorts U-came
ur.easy and considerable lines 'were taken up
oauKln.-r * material rebound In the more de
pressed properties. AVhile the Inquiry for the
leading railroads was not very uritent, still
there was a slight appreciation ' all around
which was fairly well maintained to the end.

ALAMEDA, Feb. I.â Success has
crowned the efforts of Principal Suxrallo
to introduce self-government In the disci
pline of the children of the Longfellow
School. This experiment Is the first tha*
has been made on the Pacific Coast. It
has been tried with good results in New
York. Chicago, Philadelphia. St. Louis and
Omaha and has met with the commenda
tion of educators generally...;. \
The idea of self-government is kept pre
dominant before the children at the Long
fellow School, some set form of govern
ment^ such as municipal. State or Fed
eral, being used,- .:./:â¢: Â¦' Â¦ . -,
The government of the city of Alameda
is now being followed, as nearly as possi
ble. â¢ Other forms of government will be
initiated when the. present municipal
study is thoroughly understood., by the
pupils. Â¦:':':'< .;Â¦Â¦Â¦.Â¦>Â¦.;Â¦Â¦/:-.',.::-::Â¦;â¢.â¢ '}<
The experiment was begun December 11.
A mass- meeting was called for the pur
pose of establishing a municipal govern
ment. A chairman and secretary were,
elected and a petition was drafted ask
ing permission of the principal teachers
for self-government under a charter.
Twenty freeholders were nominated and
on December 15 a freeholders' election was
held, twelve being selected to form a
charter. The charter, which was very
simple, was posted In conspicuous places
for the perusal of electors. On December
21 the charter election was held. The
charter was adopted by a vote of 77 to 6.
Nominations for officers to govern the
school were made at a mass-meeting held
January 10. The election was held a week
later, the Australian ballot system being
used. The officers elected were five trus
tees, a city clerk,: a recorder, a marshal,
a health officer, a superintendent of
streets.'/- .Â¦'â¢.'Â¦Â¦ Â¦-..;"- "Â¦-.-.. :': -. . -.- .â¢â¢Â¦_â¢/:Â¦
The deportment of Longfellow School
pupils has improved perceptibly since the
administration -of discipline/ by their asso
ciates. Teachers formerly were annoyed
by the conduct of children on the local
trains.; but under the new system no more
trouble has been ' experienced. Principal
Suzzallo pronounces the results of the ex
periment remarkable. He thinks the Idea
of self-government should be tried in all
the schools of the State. / :-.-.'â¢ :. .

passed a check upon him which he found
afterward to be bogus. He said the check
waÃ signed by A. D; Strong and was in
dorsed, by "Lieutenant Henrj-liuhr." - It
was drawn on an Oakland bank and when
It was sent I there for collection" the bank
sent word, that It had no depositor^ named
A. p. Strong. -The man from Palo Alto
wanted to know who Liuhr was and what
his standins In the army amounted to.
He said he was the man who telephoned
to the Presidio last rWednesday. . ..
He was given the only; reply possible at
the local headquarters-^-that no one knew
anything about the man; that he was
not on any of the army lists and was not
known as an officer of the army. The two
men from Palo Alto were advised to con
sult.the Chief, of Police and secure a war

would not give the name of the man she

sufficient be known, however, to make it
evident she.was looking up the history of

TOEDWOOD CITY, Feb. I.â Last night
about 12:30 o'clock the residence of H. H.

and a dastardly attempt made to commit
wholesale murder. The family had retired
for the night, there being In the house

small children and Mr. Price's brother
in-law.- ..'.'Â¦ : .' Â¦ ...v. ' ;â¢Â¦-â¢. 'â¢:Â¦ â¢Â¦
The latter was awakened soon after
midnight by some one moving In the
house. He paid no attention to this as
he thought it was Mr. Price, who had
got up to look after the children.
The next thing to attract his attention
and that of the rest of the family was
the smell of smoke coming from the
kitchen.. Thoroughly alarmed the family
hastily repaired there and discovered
Â¦some clothes, which had been hung on
a line to dry, on fire.
After extinguishing the flames Mr.
Price made an examination of the prem
ises and discovered that a screen to one
of the back windows had been cut and
the window pried open, showing that the
burglars had entered in that manner.
They left through the kitchen door. Just
how long they had been In the house is
not known, but they found time to go
through the clothes of Mr. Price, taking
therefrom about $20 In change and a goiU
Chain. The chain was subsequently found
in the street near the place, the thieves
evidently knowing that It would be strong
evidence against them if caught with it
In their possession.
The officers were immediately notified of
the crime and a search was instituted, re
sulting In the capture of two men, a negro
and a white man, in the town of Palo
Alto, five miles south ot here. The men
were brought here by Constable Chatham
and Deputy Constable Stafford and are
being held on suspicion. They had upou
their persons about the amount of money
taken from the Price residence.
It Is thought they are the men wanted
as they were seen hanging around this
neighborhood yesterday evening about 1
o'clock. They tell the officers that they
went to San Francisco last night and
slept there, coming: back to Palo Alto this
morning, but no credence U given to their
story.: . . â¢ â¢
Had not the fire been discovered when
it was the whole family might have been

guilty It will go hard with them.

RAILWAY MEN MAY GO
OUT ON A BIG STRIKE
ST. PAUL, Minn., Feb. I.â Late tornight
there seemed little prospect of avoiding a
strike on the Great Northern Railway.
Assistant Grand Master G. "W. Lee of the
Order of Railway Trainmen and Grand
Chief E. E. Clark of the Order of Railway
Conductors are expected to arrive early in
the morning. Until their arrival the vote
of the employes cannot be canvassed, that
work not having heretofore been done, as
reported. The vote is unknown as yet.
but the members of the grievance com
mittee now here [ feel sure that no agree
mentcan be reached. To-night there is
no sign of a backdown on either side, the
railway officials insisting on the accept
ance of the new schedule and the griev
ance committee still firm in their asser
tion that the employes cannot and will not
accept any schedule .' which ' includes a
proposition requiring terminal switch
work without extra compensation. Up to
midnight the new men from Chicago had
not been located in or near this city

Stamp Mill Working.
Special Dispatch to The Call. .
SAX. ANDREAS, Feb. I.â The new
twenty-stamp mill at the Sheep Ranch
mine started this morning. The Sheep
Ranch was for many years one of the
largest producers of gold in California,
but was shut down for six years because
of differences among the former owners
and the Insufficiency of the machinery.
The mine is down 1200 feet and some time
ago passed into the hands of D. Gutmann
of San Francisco and associates, who
have spent over $100,000 in machfnery and
improvements. Over &>.000,000 gallons of
water were taken out of the mine within
the past five months. The work on the
mine will now go steadily forward. .

last, night iii one, of the wildest, fastest
and noisiest indoor .baseball games seen
on a. local diamond since the inauguration
of the pastime; in this city.' At the end
of the-ninth Inhinir the representatives of
the Athenian city had scored . 'ten tallies
to four for the winged "O" and as a re
sult the; members of the latter organiza
tion.were sad. The defeat, however, was
the : best thing that could : have happened
to. the. local players. They were so im-^
bued;with their own ability, to defeat any
6t the teams in the tournament that, they
practiced seldom if at all. By their play
ing last night the Olympics showed they
had .the material but lacked unanimity in
play.-."; .",..,'-. : -' '-â¢?:Â¦ â¢::.-.- â¢Â¦;-.â¢;Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦*Â¦
On; the. other hand the Reliance team
worked together and by good fielding and
timely. batting made their opponents look
like selling-platers. ,The youngnien. from
Oakland came over to score a victory and
in this they succeeded. They also brought
over with them a gang of lusty .young
rooters, who made . noise enough to be
heard in their native town,; and who
"kicked" so hard at aUburn-halred ;"Jlm

The game was highly exciting, ; The
Olympics held a slight lead iip to the
sixth inning when they became-demoral
ized and their rivals from over the bay
passed them left them lii the rut;
The contest practically became a pitchers'
battle,. with honors in favor Cf Rosen
heirn, the Reliance twirler. Captain James
of the Olympics pitched a much speedier
ball, but the . Inability of â¢ Follanstjee: to
hold the Bpherotd was cosily to the local
nine. In the last 1 * two innings Follahsbee
allowed three runs- to come in. .He .showed
that : he was a brilliant ball player but
could . not handle, James" Â¦ speedy â¢Â¦; pitching.
Cartwright r s short nap In right field also
cost his team two runs. : Had .be been
awake he could easily have captured a
pop\fly that came his way. Butz missed
a few hard throws from the catcher, but
retrieved himself by 'a neat double play
which- he made unaided. The game was
the fastest played at; the club^ one: hour
and -ten minutes being consumed :to go

Funeral Cortege Passing Down Market^Streef;
THE body of Major General Henry Xf. Lawton Is noW
en route to Washington, where the highest officers of
the national Government are waiting to do honor- to
the memory of the brilliant soldier who met a hero's
death while battling with his country's foes in the far
off Philippines. The remains of the dead general are ac
companied by a special military escort, headed by Major
General William R. Shaf ter, commander of : the Depart
ment of California, who was detailed for the. sad duty by
the Secretary of War. The special train that carries the
body of the dead general also bears the bodies of Surgeon
Major J. X,. Armstrong and Major John A. Logan Jr. â¢-.'; â¢ .
The people of San Francisco gathered^n the streets In
large numbers yesterday -afternoon, anxious for one last
look at the caskets containing the remains of. the dead he
roes, and bared their heads In eilent reverence as the fun
eral cortege slowly wended its way to the ferry. It : had
been announced that the procession would start from Hal
sted's undertaking parlors, on Mission street, at 1:30 p. m. r
and long before that hour the street in that vicinity was
packed with sympathetic humanity. The three flag-draped
caskets were tenderly placed on the artillery caissons by;
nine non-commissioned officers, each caisson being drawn
by four black horses, and then, without the slightest con-?
fusion and with a noticeable absence of music, the march to
the ferry begaTi. A platoon of pblice. under the command pf
Captain Splllane and Serges.m Conboy, marched in front of
the cortege, followed by the military e.scort, consisting- of
Troops F and G, Sixth Cavalry. VS. S. A., and the Signal
Corps, N. G. C, commanded by Captain "West, the senior
cavalry officer. The cavalrymen were in full uniform, with
black crepe knotted on their colors. Directly behind the mili
tary escort came the artillery caissons with their sad'bur
dens and a civilian escort, consisting of a committee of. one
hundred Odd Fellows, including all the past grand officers
of the thirty-six lodges in this city; also Grand Master W.
A. Bonynge, Grand Patriarch Foster of San Diego, Past'
Grand Master Reuben H. Lloyd, Past Grand Representative
M. M. Estee and Past Grand Master and Past Grand Patri

day it was placed in. the hands of a com

&Co v : The committee immediately began
the taking of an Inventory of stock/ While
the exact figures are not: known, the lia
bilities are figured at from $120,000 to 1128,
000 arid the assets at about $10,000 more.
There is a large number of creditor^
nearly, all of whom. hold the concern liable
in comparatively small amounts. The
largest commercial liability Is said to be
under $5000. The Eastern indebtednsss Is
reported not to exceed $10,000. Practically
all the. debts are owed in this city. Nt>
bank is a creditor. The largest individual
creditor is Captain "Jim" McDonald, who
has a claim of $20,000. ' . . .
A meeting of the creditors will be held
this .afternoon at the. rooms of the San
Francisco Board of Trade. The creditors
are hundreds in number and they repre
sent almost every line of business in the
city. J. Smith, the president ot
the company,, and Harper A. Smith, secre
:tary r .Baid that they were not prepared to
givo the figures. -Neither could the com
mittee 'of creditors'. come any nearer than
a shrewd guess. The list of creditors will
b& ready, with the amounts, this afier
noon. The assets may not be Inventoried
for a few days. Barclay J. Smith's expla
nation of the trouble is brief. ..
VOwing to some reverses and probably
to increased expenses our /checks : were
throwri out of a hank last Tuesday/and
notes held by the bank amounting to JCSOO
or thereabouts were charged against the
account for funds . believed to be in the
bank to meet these checks. W.e tried to
redeem our discredited paper, but finding
the entire amount was afloat we conclud
ed to stop payment and. called a commit- :
tee of our creditors together, who. decided
that the best thing to bo done ; was to
place the entire matter In the hands of
the Board of. Trade, which was done.; Our
business has grown to almost $1,000,000 per
