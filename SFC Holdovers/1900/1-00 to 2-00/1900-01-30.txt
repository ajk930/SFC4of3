CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 29.â When Governor Gage
called the extra session of the Legisla
ture the Southern Pacific presented a pro
gramme directing an immediate ballot for
United States Senator. It was expected
that the members opposed to Burns' elec
tion would be taken -by surprise. Pre
caution was observed to keep the ar
rangement from the knowledge of the
public. Dibble was directed on the quiet
to find the precedents for balloting: for the
second Tuesday after the legislature con
vened, but the precedents could not be
found. The Call gave the people of the
State notice that Burns, Herrin and Gage
were planning to begin balloting before
the time designated in the Federal statute
regulating the election of United States
Senators. Exposed, the schemers had to
meet the contest In the open. They came
to Sacramento boasting that the pro
gramme would be rushed through and
Burns' election secured before the oppos
ing elements had time to organize their
forces. Much to their surprise, the plot
ters ran up against an effective anti-
Burns organization in each house of .the
Legislature. "When Burns, Lindley. Hig
glna, Dibble and other agents of the
Southern Pacific found themselves out
flanked, outgeneraled and confronted by a
superior force, they laid down their arms
and surrendered. The talk of resistance
proved a repetition of the same old Mexi
can bluff. They accepted with the best
grace possible the terms submitted by
fifty-five resolute Republicans, hence
there will be no balloting for United
States Senator until Tuesday of next
week. If at that time Burns be Jn the
field as a candidate he may receive 27
votes.
The members who fought so gallantly
throughout the regular session to save
the State from the odium of Burns' elec
tion have gained knowledge by experience,
and ascertained the value of . organiza
tion and concerted movement. They, do
not take alarm when the Mexican beats
the tom-tom and shouts that the "battle
will be won next Thursday."
Every one is asking the question, "What
induced United States Marshal Shine, who
vigorously supported U.S. Grant less than
one year ago. to change his mind and en
ter the service of Dan Burns?** The story
goes that Shine was , engaged by the
Southern Pacific to deliver to the Mexican
the votes of Assemblymen McDonald of
Alameda and BJood of Calaveras. There
are some . indications that McDonald is
listening to the song of the Herrin bird
as sung by . proxy Shine. The story goes
that McDonald declined to sign the agree

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 29.
â D. M. Bums is no longer a factor in the contest for
United States Senator. He is beaten before a vote has
been taken, and California has been spared the humiliating
shame and disgrace of being dishonored by him as her repre
sentative in the National Congress. A great victory has been
won for honest politics and the purity of public men, for to
night fifty Republican members of the Legislature stand pledged
above their own signatures not to vote for Dan Burns in a cau
cus. The splendid triumph, in which all decent Californians
must rejoice, is beyond question. There is no possibility of a
change in the situation. The Call has interviewed every one of
these fifty men and all pledge their honor that under no circum
stances in a caucus will they vote for the Mexican whose pub
lic life has been a stain upon the good name of California and
whose even' act has contributed to shadow others with sus
oicion.
The man whose activity in this State has been the disease,
and not the health of public life, may pack his belongings and

leave Sacramento, defeated in the realization of an ambition that
possessed nothing noteworthy except its impudence and its pre
sumption. The followers of Burns are not ignorant to the
crash of their leader's hopes. They have seen the men who
have been true to their sense of a great public duty agitating a
unity of action which means the death of Burnsism in the poli-
This agitation has borne splendid fruit. One by one the
men who do not wish to be stained by association with the
Mexican pledged themselves not to vote for him. One by
the little host grew greater and the Burns followers became
graver. Twenty names, then thirty, forty and fifty were gained
âthe cause of pure politics had scored a superb triumph. The
Mexican's shouters were dumfounded. Their own boasting and
bluster had deceived themselves and they could hardly realize
that the battle had been lost. Their leader and the manager of
Burns announced that imperative business called him back to
San Francisco.
The fight was over and the shadow of utter failure fell upon

body to give any official recognition to
the document until. Gage had been decent
enough to transmit a copy, a little formal
ity which the Governor had entirely over
looked and which the Senators looked
upon in the nature of an Insult.
Senator Leavitt volunteered the state
ment that he thought Gage would attend
to the matter in due course of time. The
Senate, however, decided to ignore thÂ«
message entirely until Gage learns how
to be decent and profits by the knowledge.
The message follows
HENRY T. MAKES HIS "BAA."
"Gentlemen of the Senate and Assembly
of the State of California: In reconven
ing your honorable body in extraordinary
session for the purposes expressed In my
proclamatlon it becomes my duty to stata
more fully the views which I entertain re
garding the business to be transacted and
the necessity for this extra session. After
careful consideration for many months of
the question whether, among other things,
the expense to the people which may ac
crue from this session should outweigh
the exigency of convoking the Legisla
ture, I have fully determined that the
question of immediate disbursement
should be subordinated to public duty and
public necessity, and that this necessity,
above all other matters, demands the
election of a United States Senator, so
that California shall stand equal in rep
resentation with her sister States in the
Senate of the United States.
LOOK OUT FOR TEMBLORS.

PALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 29.â Governor Gage
I read a message to the Legislature
I this afternoon, the nature of which
* bears out the general impression
that he can make himself as sub
limely ridiculous as any man that ever
occupied a public office in the State, and
that he can do it, too, without half try-
Ing. The document was Gage's official
apology to the lawmakers and the peo
ple for calling the extra session. It places
him in the pitiable spectacle of feeling
called upon to offer an excuse for his
every action. His demeanor while read
ing It excited sympathy. He trembled as
a man with the palsy, and at times when
his rage overcame him his voice gave way
to a feeble squeak that made hla audience
creep.
When the Governor was ushered before
the Senators and Assemblymen he did not
receive a cordial greeting. There was
some applause from the Bums touts and
heelers, but even they seemed ashamed to
declare themselves too boldly. Gage at
tacked the newspapers that had refused to
be silent on the conspiracy to eiect the
Colonel to the United States Senate. ThÂ©
Mexican's followers applauded Gage's ef
forts to vent his spleen, for they, like the
Governor, do not take kindly to a fearless
press.
Gage announced that none of the sug
gestions made in his call for the extra
session were intended to add political
prestige to his office, and for fear that
he was not clearly understood on the point
he reiterated the statement at frequent
intervals throughout the wearying read-
Ing.
The Governor did not succeed in keep
ing his audience interested in his message.
Those who took him seriously fell asleep,
and those who saw the ridiculous side of
It all were so highly amused that they
managed somehow to live through it.
Grove Johnson was among the first to
succumb. He was slumbering early
during Gage's race with words, but when
mention was made of 'a "libeling press"
he started from his repose like a man
awakening from a. horrible nightmare.
Among others who took advantage of
sleep to save themselves from the torture
and mortification of listening to the Chief
Executive of the State make a show of
himself were Senators Davis, Morehouse,
Bulla and Smith and Assemblymen Wade.
Jllson, Raub, Clough. Cargill and Mack.
And there were many others.
An audible sigh of relief went up when
Gage finished his harangue and bowed
himself out of sight. "When the Senate
reconvened a motion was offered to enter
the message on the journal, but Senator
Smith objected. He expressed the opinion
that It was beneath the dignity of that

sertion of justice and manhood, have rebelled and his end has
The fifty members of the Legislature who have given their
pledged honor that they will never vote for Bums in caucus are
ready at any time to put themselves to the test. A caucus can
not be held too soon for them, for they are eager for the issue
that will register them in the good opinion of Californians, irre
spective of party affiliations. The taint of dishonest politics and
of an impossible politician has now been removed from the
Senatorial situation.
The honorable members of the Legislature who have
cleared the political atmosphere of its disease have now only to
unite upon some man who is worthy of their suffrages and who
will worthily represent them in the United States Senate. There
are many such in the ranks of the Republican party and the
Legislature can clothe itself with double honor by electing such
a man to the high dignity that even the preposterous, arrogant,
impudent ambition of a defaulter and a trickster made cheap.
The Call reiterates what it has said many times. It has no
candidate for the exalted position of United States Senator and
will suggest none. The only purpose of .this paper, and one
which has inspired its unremitting energy, was to save the State
and the Republican party from the shame and the, degradation
that would have followed inevitably the election of Burns. He
and all he represents are now driven from influence in public af
fairs. He and all he typifies have been whipped by the lash of
indignant men from the places that decent Californians de
mand, by the right of public spirit and honesty, as their own.
The Legislature has now its second duty to perform, and if it be
as unflinching in the performance of the second as it has been
courageous in obeying the first the conspiracy of a truckling,
complaisant, time-serving Governor will have been the agency
not of evil but of public good.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 29.â Lieutenant Governor
Neff called the Senate to order at 1 o'clock
this afternoon. Very little ceremony at
tended the reconvening of the upper
house. The matters which promised to
create - some preliminary sparring were
disposed of early in the day at the Re
publican caucus, and to-day's session
hardly amounted to more than a ratifica
tion of the caucus programme.
Immediately after the Lieutenant Gov
ernor Â¦ announced the purpose of the ex
tra session and the call was read Senator
Cutter offered a resolution that the Sen
ate proceed to organize and appoint offi
cers and attaches. The resolution was

recess was taken to 4:30 o'clock to enable
the Committee on Patronage to fix mat

LONGS FOR A HARBOR.
The Governor next considered the sec
ond, third * and fourth grounds of his
proclamation, dealing with .harbor Im
provement for San Francisco. He point
ed out to some extent that the, growing
commercial necessities of the State re
quire greater harbor facilities, for San
Francisco Bay. The length of . the
wharves of that harbor is now limited by
law, and it is proposed that something be
done that this limit caq^be removed. The
Governor quoted entire a communication
from the State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners of which "my -distinguished and
very able predecessor in office, Hon.
James H. Budd, is the attorney," show
ing the necessity of prompt action in the
matter. The Governor then continued:
"The immediate necessity for this leg
islation may be perceived, not only from
such petitions, but also from the fact,
not of unusual occurrence, that last
Thursday there Were no unoccupied
berths for ships in the harbor of San
Francisco, and twelve deep-water vessels
were overdue. - Â¦Â»Â¦ Â¦ â¢ .' . â¢ â¢-
"The shipping interests of , this State
are dependent upon the proper ImproVe-i
ment of Its principal rivers 'and harbors^
and where defects exist, in our. . laws,
which are, incompatible with new condi
tions arising from increasing trade and
greater development of our resources. It
becomes a public duty to eliminate from
ouÂ» statute books those defects which
are opposed to the progress of our State
and the prosperity of our people." All the
people of the State are vitally interested
in the development of the San Francisco
harbor. The fostering care of the State
is. a guaranty of the State's continued
concern for the future of this great har
bor. With the betterment of trade and
enhanced business advantages of coast
cities the interior of the State will like
wise be improved. As a people we are
interdependent and a material impedi
ment to the commercial progress of the
city of San Francisco, which contains
nearly one-fourth of the State's popula
tion, is a corresponding obstacle to the
interests of other parts of this state.
Above all. It is the right and duty of the
State and not of a municipality to extend
sovereign care and management over,
the navigable waters of the State. For
the State to attempt to abandon that
right and duty would be an-effort to fore
go one of- its most sacred- functions. <
A SOLEMN TRUST.
"The .sovereign control, of the. State
over its navigable waters, is a solemn
trust, held for the. benefit of all the peo
ple, which the State cannot absolutely re- ;
sign in favor of municipalities. The lan
guage of the highest; court of the, nation
in a recent case ls decisive of this propo
sition, 'and that court has there defined
the limits of local and private control."
, Sections of recent decisions are 'quoted
to sustain the position taken and the sov
ereign right of the State to control its
harbors and bays is treated at length.
This section of hte message was then con
cluded as follows:
"No municipality or section can usurp
this sovereign right, nor can any act of
the Legislature surrender the State's sov
ereign control. It is, therefore, evident
that the matters called to your attention
for the improvement of the harbor of San
Francisco are of general pressing impor
tance and designed for the benefit of all
the people of the State, and, were there
no other reasons, would alone require this
extraordinary session.
HOMEOPATHIC AMENDMENTS.
"The amendments which I have suggest
ed, if adopted by you, will afford adequate
relief and accomplish all that is necessary
for the immediate improvement ; of the
harbor, without levying taxes upon the
people, or even necessitating the Issuance
of bonds." ]: : }U%\-j- .- : .'Â¦Â¦'Â¦_
.The fifth reason specified In the proc
lamation, the necessity of creating a Com
missioner of Public Works, was treated
at length. It was pointed out that such
a bill had been passed at the regular ses
sion and had received the approval of the
Governor. Certain Irregularities in the
history of the measure, however, make
it "at least an unsettled proposition of
law," and further, to quote the Gov
ernor's words, "I . am Â¦ satisfied that the
act itself does not express the intention
of the people acting through their rep
resentatives, and I have therefore called
your attention to the defects in this most
important legislation, so essential for the
prosperity of farmers and other citizens
of the Sacramento and San Joaquin val
leys, and to the business and property of
the people of the various cities and towns
along the. Sacramento and San Joaquln
rivers arid their tributaries."
RIVER IMPROVEMENTS.
The message next dealt with the Gov
ernor's Views on the amending of the law,
as set forth In the sixth article of his
message, so that river improvements may
be extended above the mouth of the
Feather River. Of this feature pt the mat
ter, he said: ;.;Â¦ '
"It was held in the opinion of the At
torney General, rendered April 20 l<os
that neither the Auditing Board nor the
Commissioner of Public Works could ex
pend any part of the money appropriated
for the Improvement of the Sacramento
and San Joaquln rivers above the mouth
Â°f the Feather River. In consequence of
this condition of the law not only are
thousands of acres of valuable and pio
ductiye lands in Yolo, Sutter and Yulia
and other counties imperiled, but the. in
ability, to perform such work above *he
mouth of the Feather River results in se
rious detriment to work already done
upon the Sacramento River."
The. concluding paragraph of this .sec
tion of the message reads as follows:
. "Wh6n we consider that the Federal
Government has already appropriated
large sums of money for the construction
of restraining barriers and other improve
ments on the Sacramento and Feather
rivers and has now able engineers en
gaged ln\the work under the Secretary
of War, pursuant to the act. of Cqngress
creating the . California Debris Commis
sion, it would be only the exercise of
good faith on the part of this State, apart
from the incalculable benefit to our peo
ple, to co-operate with the Federal Gov
ernment In the work of improvement in
directions which are not allowed to the
United States engineers under said act
of Congress." . ."
?THE WIDE TIRE LAW.
The grounds for the repeal of the wide
tire law, as proposed in the seventh sec
tion of the proclamation, are that the act
is inartistically drawn, contains pro
visions of doubtful constitutionality and
that its enforcement would cause tr.oubii;
and distress to thousands of farmers and
other persons using wagons within- the
State. . '; â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ ;
SOMETHING ABOUT MINING.
The eighth ground for the proclamation,
tl^e repeal of the mining law, was recom
mended to avoid possible litigation owing
to a clerical error which crept into the
lirst section of the act.
HE SHIES AT LAND "RINGS."
The reasons given for proposed changes
in the law relative to the Eale of State
lands are that many thousands of acres of
lafid, under the existing laws, have passed
under the control of land "rings" at a
value of $1 25 an acre, to be at once resold
by them at prices ranging from $1 per
acre and upward.
Until proper amendments are made to
the laws relating to our public land,
power, it is set forth In the message,
should be vested in the Governor to with
draw from sale the school lands, scrip
upon which is now being used to take the
place of, the Valentine and Porterfield
scrip.
The alleged frauds that have, been prac
ticed i;pon' the State under t s existing
laws are discussed at length, and the Gov
ernor gives it as his opinion that it would
have been his duty to convoke the Legis
lature, in extraordinary session. to amend
the iand laws had no other reason ex
isted for the call, "for it Is estimated,"
says ".the Governor, l! that hundreds , of.
thousands of dollars would be thereby
gained for the State."
LUNACY HENRY'S FORTE
The necessity of empowering the State
Lunacy. Commission to fix the salaries of
all officers and employes, as set forth In
the eleventh ground for the proclamation,
is given as due to the fact that the com
mission cannot at present cut down the
salaries of such employes, although if
such cut could . be made their compensa
tion would still be ample. If this power
be granted the commission, the Governor
sets forth,, it will save the people of the
State more than $20,000 annually for years
to come.
REMOVAL OF APPOINTEES.
Regarding the request that the Legis
lature grant the Governor power to re T
move appointees for causa the Governor
says: '-.-'-â¢â¢ -;Â»'
fin the twelfth and fourteenth grounds
of the proclamation I have suggested that
the Governor be granted the power to re
move for cause officers appointed for
definite terms,andj|n the fifteenth ground
I have advised that the power be like
wise vested in the Governor of'temporar
ily suspending for cause confirmees of the
Senate. In thus requesting this necessary
authority I have not harbored a single
partisan thought nor desired such power
for political purposes, but my sole desire
was that the responsibility which is laid
upon the .Governor by the people should
not be hampered through his utter help
lessness to remove officers who misbe
have themselves in office to the detriment
of the public, or wfcu may be guilty of
crime. If the Governor is to Â¦oe neid
responsible to the people, and if the party
which nominated and elected him is to be
held likewise responsible to the electors
for the Gpvernor's conduct of State af
fairs, he â¢ should be invested with power
commensurate with that responsibility.
.Personally I would prefer, were I not
bound by my sacred oath, of office, to be
shorn of the responsibility for the acts
of others, and would not desire even that
the power of appointment to office should
rest with me, for among j the most pain
ful and. trying duties of office have been
those when I have been ceaselessly im
portuned and entreated to grant positions
to worthy but rival candidates.

Hon. VTilllain McDonald, Assembly Chamber,
Sacramento: As your lifelong friend, I beg
of you not to vote for Burns. Tour constitu

Your friend. F. R. BASSETT.
A mass-meeting of Republicans will be

election of Burns, at which a petition will
be prepared and signed and sent to Sac
ramento, urging McDonald not to bring
disgrace upon the section he represents
and politically stultify himself bycastins
his vote for a person whose very name
has come to be a stench in the nostrils of
all decent citizens.

dition ofthe^law an officer, once appoint
ed for a definite term, may be guilty of
crime, continually dishonor his office, and
enjoy the fruits of his malfeasance, by
resorting to thÂ£ courts to', defend his
crimes. To illustrate . the -"very limited
authority vested In the Governor,--! will
state that a few months ago serious
crimes w^re' charged . against an ..-officer
now holding the same State office, and a
petition was forwarded to me by one of
the members accusing him in direct lan
guage with flagrant crimes.. Knowing
that the power was not given me to in
vestigate the charges and, if true, to
right the wrong by the removal of the
officer, in order to silence a hostile press,
which had used this incident for political
and personal ends. I requested the opin
ion of the Attorney General, who replied
in writing, assuring me of my utter in
ability to remove any appointed officer
whatever who held office for a definite
term."
FILCHES BUDD'S THUNDER.
The Governor then quoted from the
messages of his predecessor to show that
Governor Budd had recommended that the
authority asked for be granted to the Gov
ernor of the State. Ja conclusion the Gov
ernor said:
"The foregoing are some of many rea
sons which I hold in support of the
grounds specified in the proclamation con
vening you in extraordinary, session, it
Is to be deplored that there are a few
persons who, by reason of their own un
worthy motives, attribute to me improper
political purposes in assembling you to
gether; whereas, in truth and In fact, I
have merely obeyed the promptings of im
partial duty and the mandates of the law."
A LESSON IN FINANCE.
"If you shall conclude to pass the va
rious lnws suggested in the proclamation
there will thereby be saved to the StaU
sums of money largely in excess of the
expenditures which will be incurred on
account of convoking this Legislature,
even should the cost thereof exceed the
high estimates of those who, false' to th?
interests of their country, have bitterjy
assailed th's call for an extra session.
"Whether or not you differ from me as
to the necessity of legislation , in detail
upon all of the topics suggested for legis
lation is to me unimportant, only as it af
fects our common country, for the respon
sibility now rests with your honorable
body and not with me alone. You will;
nevertheless, agree that your duty abso
lutely requires that the business of the
session be transacted with the utmost dis
patch consistent with the gravity of the
subjects involved. 'Â¦;. Â¦â¢Â¦...Â¦
MALIGNANT PREDICTIONS.
"Despite the malignant predictions,
which ; through private malice have been
published, that this extraordinary ses
sion, would engulf the State in vast ex
pense, my confidence, in your sense of
duty and in your ability, gained by a per
sonal knowledge of your conduct of legis
lative affairs during the thirty-third ses

DESERTED BY HIS FLOCK.
The Governor here referred to the fact
that he had urged this argument upon
the Legislature in his message of March
IS. 1899, and continued: "Through unhap
py and hidden causes you failed to heed
my appeal on that occasion, and subse
quent events have justified the fears
which I then entertained that the grand
national administration," under the guid
ance of our great President, might meet
with some opposition from those who
ought to be first to maintain our country's
grandeur.-
DISCORDANT VOICES RAISED.
Already/ with the fruits of a victorious
war within our control,' discordant voices
are raised to obstruct, our country's ex
pansion. The enemies of progress seek
to sow the seeds of distrust. The retro
gressive few struggle to oppose the na
tion's majestic strides eastward and west
ward. Discarding the la.ws of civilization
and national evolution, these obstruction
ists would once more reduce, if they
could, this magnificent empire to its
original thirteen States. America, proud
of her prestige among nations, must go
forward, not backward. The doctrine of
the rights of man roust be taught on the
isles of the Orient. The flag which Bym
bolizes these rights likewise symbolizes
freedom, and no people above whom it
floats can bear the shackles of the slave.
"Our country has a moral as well as
a material duty tc perform respecting our
newly acquired islands. It must un
selfishly ishow to the people of the Philip
pines, of Guam and the other isles of the
Pacific the virtue or American law and
American liberty. Our republic must be
an exemplar through social and commer
cial contact. Our messengers of peace
and civilization must educate the inhab
itants of our new possessions in the in
dustrial and mechanic arts and in the
beet methods of agricultural development.
The iron of war must be transformed
into implements of husbandry. Racial
hates must yield to American philan
thropy, and crude and savage customs
to American morality.
GAGE GIVF* SOME POINTERS.
"To achieve all this we should have
wise laws and prudent councilors, and
Californiaâ the westernmost State of the
Union and the commercial gate for Amer
ica's Oriental tradeâ is deeply concerned
in this great and necessary work. I am,
therefore, conscientiously convinced that
an essential step in this direction is the
election of a United States Senator.
'â¢Being conscious of the rectitude of our
purposes, no lurking assassin of character
nor cowardly libeler need hope for a single
instant to intimidate or sway us from the
faithful discharge of our duty . to our
country and to our State because of the
dastardly menace of printed blackmail.

tion.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 29.â The Assembly
reconvened to-day by sending a simple
message to the Senate to the effect that
It had resumed business at the old stand
In accordance with the Governor's procla
mation and out of regard for the "extra
ordinary reasons" which the executivi-
gel. He has deprived the Capitol. o' his
expansive and expanding' presence. Thert
may be no necessary connection between
the two facts, but hardware dealers
there has been a slump in the price cf
cuspidors.
While the Senatorial question remains
the vital. topic of discussion, there' is an
other which is now engaging attention.
It has reference to the measures suggest
ed by the Governor in his call to give him
absolute power over the tenure of the
office of his appointees.
Gage is itching for patronage and re
venge. He is goaded by Burns to use his
power and swing the lash of patronage
as he, did at the regular session. The
parasites which the Mexican fastened
upon the Board of Health of San Fran
cisco are now clinging to him in greedy
hunger. They must be fed and Gage wants
to feed them on the State. He asks,
therefore, that he be given power to make
his appointees the creatures of his caprice.
Mixed with this desire to preserve the
political existence of Burns with patron
age in the Governor's brain is the lust for
revenge.
He wants to punish, among others. Dr.
Gardiner of the Stockton Insane Asylum,
Cooper of the State Mining Bureau, and
the superintendent of the Agnews Asy
lum, Dr. J. A. Crane.
These men have shown an independence
of character which Ls extremely distaste
ful to the Governor and he wants to re
move them. He has men more pliable
than they, more ready to accept his dic
tation regarding patronage and more
eager to submit to his fantastic notions
respecting a policy of administration. As
a matter of personal interest, therefore.
Gage wants something more than the
power he now enjoys. He will find that
this particular want is to remain unsat
isfied.
A majority of the members of the Leg
islature are emphatically opposed to giv
ing- the Governor the arbitrary power he
demands. He will have to worry alone
with what he already has, as "the Legis
lature will give him no more. The pro
posed measure, which threatens demor
alization and the anarchy of political mis
management to the institutions of thÂ«
State, will be beaten by a decisive major
ity.

Raub of Yuba offered a substitute

Democratic votes against It. The vote
stood 61 to 16.
Assemblyman Wade offered a resolution
calling upon the chair to appoint a com

Assembly had convened, and ask if he
had any communications to make.
Speaker Anderson named "Wade, Belshaw
and Meade, and later Meade, acting as
chairman, reported that his Excellency
had a message to read to both houses
and desired that they meet in Joint con

necessary resolution and at 4:30 the ex

A committee of five, consisting of Raub,
Belshaw, "White, Merritt and Kenneally,
was appointed by the chair to report upon
the attaches and officers of the Assembly
and make recommendations as to a 're

of Johnson was given more time for its

BURNS MEN FOILED
IN THE ASSEMBLY
Tney Fall in Their Attempt to Bring
on a Senatorial Ballot
To-Pay.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 29.â This afternoon Assem
blyman H. C. Dibble of San Francisco and
Assemblyman Grove L. Johnson of Sac
ramento were forced upon the floor of the
Assembly and compelled to renounce in
the name of their Mexican master tho Job
they had hatched up to bring on the Sen
atorial balloting to-morrow by preventing
the reorganization of the Legislature. One
of Burns' greatest hopes of victory was
In beginning the vote for Senator before
thosÂ» who are opposed to him had had
time to organize their forces and decide
upon their procedure. That hope lost Its
Identity to-day in the first victory of the
anti-Burns element and It was lost only
after the hardest sort of a fight on both
sides of the Senatorial deadline. ,V . -
As It Is, the Assembly is not reorgan
ized; it Is merely convened under the same
order of things established at Its opening
and not extraordinary session, but tho
danger of that condition was eliminated
by the castiron promises forced from the
Mexican's lieutenants after a battle royal
in open session.
Early this morning there was a little
meeting of the leaders of the different fac
tions. Dibble was called In, as was John
son, and It was clearly demonstrated to.
them that they did not have a dead man's
chance. to put through the job they had
up their sleeves. Under pressure, they
finally agreed to take the lloor as soon as
the Assembly should be convened and
make open and unqualified agreement not
to propose a ballot for Senator until a
week from to-morrow.
Relying upon this agreement, Valentine,
when the opportunity offered, handed up
a resolution Instructing the clerk to notify
the Senate that the Assembly, Was In ses
sion pursuant to the call of the Governor.
Dibble rose apparently to keep his agree
ment, and argued for the adoption of Val
entine's resolution. It very shortly de
veloped, however, that Dibble Was giving
his agreement the overlook; he argued for
the resolution all right, for It did not pro-

Interesting Data Pertaining to the
Spanish-American War.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 29.âSurgeon Gen
eral Sternberg has compiled some figures
as a basis of mortality calculations in the
Spanish-American war, which Incidentally
developed the interesting fact that the
mobilization of the army during the Span
ish-American war was accomplished in
only a fraction of the time required to as
sotWs an equivalent number of troops at
the outbreak cf the civjl war. In Alay,
ISCI, the main strength of the Union army
was lC.lfil, and in one month It had in
creased to only C 6.950. In the first-month
of the Spanish-American war the United
States army, starting at 163.726, had in
creased before the dose of the month to
203.526. This'ls regarded as .a remarkable
feat of military organization, far surpass

PRETTY GIRL ELOPE
"Wylackie John's" Nlneteeh=
Year=Old Daughter Departs
With a Penniless Old Man,
Special Dispatch to The Call
COVELO, Jan. ?3.â The exciting news
topic of Hound Valley to-night is the sen
sational details of the elopement some
lime yesterday of pretty 19-year-old Oatie
\VhattÂ« j n. the accomplished daughter of
"Wylackie John." Cattle King White's
famous vaquero, with William Tatham, a
man nearly an octoeenarlan. Oatie lived
with her mother, Mrs. Palmer by name
by a second marriage, on a large cattle
nnd stock ranch, and Tatham was em
ployed upon the ranch as a horse breaker
and trainer.
Oatie's principal amusement upon this
Immense range was horseback riding, and
h^r skill as an equestrienne brought her
much into the company of Tatham. Miss
Whatten had never outwardly manifested
any particular regard for Tatham % and
the startling fact of their elopement has
prostrated her parents and excited the
community. The couple took flight
mounted on two of the best horses pro
curable on the ranch and have been
traced In the direction of Glenn County
through a mountain trail that leads to tha
v.iMs of Anthony Peakâ a peak that al
ways has been regarded as almost im
passable on account of its being rugged
and very precipitous. Their ultimate des
tination wpuld appear to be Orland, Glenn
County, as it is known that Miss What-
ten's baggage was secretly shipped on
yesterday's 6tage to that point.
This, however, may be only a ruse to
mislead her parents, as telegrams ex
changed with Orland to-day elicited no
clew to their whereabouts. Should no in
formation be received from the Glenn
County authorities to-morrow a searching
party, headed by her brother, will be or
ganized to scout' Anthony Peak.
Tatham has no visible means of liveli
hood and should Miss Whatten consent
to marriage it would be one of love on her
part. In the absence of official news that
matrimony Is the object of the elopement
opinions are reserved by friends of both
parties. Oatie's home life has been one
tilled with happiness and every wish
satisfied, and why she should forsake
home, mother, brother and sister for the
companionship of a man 74 years of age.
old enough to be her grandfather and
penniless at that, is Inconceivable. Mrs.
Palmer, Oatie's mother, bitterly laments
her daughter's waywardness, and the
household to-ni?ht Is overwhelmed with
grief. It is difficult to state to-night what
leg-al steps may be taken In the matter,
as the age of the young woman will hard
ly admit of any criminal charge. It is
known that Tatham has had two unfor
tunate matrimonial experiences, having
been deserted by two of his former wives.
He is the father of grown-up children.
The records of Mendoclno County show
no record of his having: procured a di
vorce, and a marriage with Miss Whatten
now would place him in a grave position.

HANFORD BANKER'S TROUBLES
HIS ALLEGED ESCAPADES FILED
TN AN ANSWEB.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HANFORD, Jan. 29.â A sensational
damage suit was filed in the Superior
Court of Kings County to-day. The plain
tiff is Mrs. Nancy Parlin of Los Angeles,
and the defendant Mrs. Nellie Macadam,
a prominent and handsome society wo
man of Hanford. Mrs. Parlin alleges that
Mrs. Macadam j has alienated the affec
tions of her husband, Warren W. Parlin,
president of the Farmers and Merchants'
Bank In this city and a wealthy vineyard
ist.
The complaint alleges that the plaintiff
and her husband had lived happily to
gether for forty-two years up- to 1892,
when he first met Mrs. Macadam In this
city. She states that for the past two
years plaintiff and her husband have been
living apart, and she alleges that for the
past year Parlin and Mrs. Macadam have
resided at the Artesia Hotel in this city
and there occupied adjoining rooms, and"
also at the Renton Hotel in San Fran
cisco, and that they have been intimate
for the past year. .
Mrs. Parlin has also filed another suit
seeking to recover certain property that
Parlin Is alleged to have deeded to Mrs.
Macadam without plalnti "s knowledge or
consent. A few days ago Mrs. Parlin filed
a suit for dicorce in Los Angeles, alleging
extreme cruelty, and naming Mrs. Ma
cadam as co-respondent.
The suit has created great excitement
here owing to the prominence of the peo
ple involved in the case. About four years
ago the husband of Mrs. Macadam, who
Is much older than she. went to Alaska,
leaving his wife here. Parlin is an old
man, while Mrs. Macadam Is quite young.
Mrs. Macadam's husband is .now in Wash
ington State and she left here about a
week ago ostensibly on a visit to her
mother in Canada. Those interested In the
plaintiff's case say that it will be fought
to a finish.

SENATORS SCORE
BRITISH CONSUL
Angered by an Attack
Upon Mason.
â¢ WASHINGTON, Jan. 29,-Senator Ma
son (R.) of Illinois arose to-day, soon
after the Senate convened, to a question
of privilege, and sharply attacked the
British Government and the British Vice
Consul at New Orleans, because. of an in
terview in which the Vice Consul had as
sailed Mason for the position he ' had
taken In behaif of the Transvaal repub
lic in Us war with Great Britain. Mason
attacked not only the Consul but the pol
icy of Great Britain in levying war upon
an inferior nation.
â¢ Hoar of Massachusetts thought "-the
Consul's purported .remarks so serious
that they ought to be investigated by the
Government, but at the same time he
deprecated any attack, upon Great Brit
ain, with the people of which the people
of the United States ought not only to'
live in peace, but as loving and devoted
as friends.
Lodge of Massachusetts sharply ar
raigned the British Consul for his ut
terances against a United States Senator
and believed they ought not to be lightly
passed.
Tinman of South Carolina delivered a
forceful and quite characteristic speech
on the Philippines, in which he main
tained that this Government ought to ex
tend to the Filipinos the right to govern
themselves, the United States guarding
them against the aggression of other na
tions.
WEATHER BUREAU BILL

Aged Employes.
WASHINGTON; Jan. . 29. -The bill for
the reorganization and improvement of
the Weather Bureau, which includes pro
vision for pensioning disabled and aged
employes of the service, received a black
eye in the House. The bill was bitterly
fought by the opponents of civil pension
rolls on account of tha life tenure pro
visions it contained," and it was side
tracked on a test vote of 5". to 63. Al
though the Speaker ruled that It remain
ed unfinished business when the House
was again in committee of the whole, the
opponents of the measure believe the ac
tion of the day kills it.
The early portion of the day was de
voted to a lively scrimmage over the Sul
zer resolution to investigate the acts of
Secretary Gage, which the Committee on
Rules recommended should be sent to the
Ways and Means Committee, as the lat
ter committee had the response of the
Secretary in its possession. There was no
opposition to the .proposed action, but
Richardson of Tennessee and Sulzer of
New York used it as a text for renewing
their attacks on the Secretary. Gage was
defended by Hopkins of Illinois. Hill of
New York and Dalzell of Pennsylvania.
A bill to require pilots and officers of
steam vessels to make oath to their ap
plications for license was passed. v'O..

MINOR WITNESSES HEARD.

Intimations Against Toole.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 29.â The Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections to
day heard a number of witnesses on
minor points Involved in the charges
against Senator Clark of Montana. The
Protestants took occasion during the day
to withdraw nil Intimations against Hon.
J. K. Toole, who withdrew from the Mon
tana contest for United States Senate
under circumstances which the protest
ants were at first inclined to consider sus
piciously favorable to Clark. The prose
cution also declined during the day to put
two witnesses on the stand who had been
summoned at its Instance, because tho
men had talked unsatisfactorily since
their arrival in Washington. Both ex-
Senator Edmunds and Mr. Campbell said
it would be unfair to both sides to call the
witnesses to testify.

has been received at the War Department:
"MANILA, Jan. 29.â Adjutant General.

mention of the Senatorial proposition.
Raub of Yuba was ready for some such
play, and promptly, offered a substitute
for Valentine's resolution, which provided
for reorganization, and made several
changes in the list of attaches.
Dibble raised the point of order that
Raub's substitute made appointments tc
offices already filled, and could not be
considered for that reason. Brown of San
Mateo* spoke to the point of order and
contended that reorganization was re
quired by law,. as the present session was
not a continuation of the last one. but
distinctly a session by Itself. Dibble In
terrupted him frequently and finally got
the 'floor to explain more fully his point
He cited the fact that upon three pre
vious, occasions the Assembly had gone
into extra session without reorganization,
and declared he could see no reason for
departing from timeworn precedent.
Eventually he submitted the question to
Speaker Anderson, who announced that
although he was convinced that Dibble's
position was correct he did not care to de
cide the question, and would rule the point
not well taken In order that It might be
decided by the members themselves. Dib
ble objected, and while he was telling
why Johnson went over to Raub's desk
and attempted to talk him into withdraw
ing hi -3 resolution. The Burns push knew
that their one chance lay In the sustain
ing of Dibble's point of order. The votes
against them were easily two to one, and
they did not want to take the chance of
a roll call. '. 'Â¦ -\;"i''/'--'. : A--: Â¦-.
Rtiub refused to withdraw unless Dib
ble and Johnson made good the agree
ment of the morning. In this he was
backed by Brown and a number of qthers
of the opposition. Johnson finally called
Dibble Into the parley, and after an
other Ineffectual. assault they gave In and
Johnson went back to his seat. He said
that In his opinion no ballot for Senator
could be taken legally until the second
week anyway. He also said that, wheth
er the Assembly was reorganized or not,
the members and attaches would get their
pay. Then he raid he hoped Raub would
withdraw his substitute, and made way
for Dibble. .1
Dibble said It was all a case of forget
fulness on his part. He had Intended to
say Just what Johnson had said, and he
would go even farther than he had, and
on behalf of the Burns forces agree that
there should be no ballot demanded until
Tuesday of next week. Upon this Raub
withdrew his substitute, and Valentine's
original resolution was adopted.
ANTI-BURNS SENATORS
WIN IN THE CAUCUS
The Reorganization Plan Goes
Through With but Little
Effort.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 29.â Several hard blows
were delivered at Dan Burns to-day dur
ing a caucus of the Republican members
of the Senate. The anti-Burns Senators
stood out for a reorganization of the Sen
ate and won with hardly an effort. The
Burns people made a play to create a big
block of patronage, and failed to carry
their scheme through. The Burns men
wanted an early vote on the Senatorship.
The cau<jus decided not to take a ballot
untfl Tuesday of next week.
It was expected that the colonel's forces
would make a hard fight against reorgani
zation, as they had openly avowed that
they were opposed to the plan. They
based great hope on the likelihood of rush
ing a vote on the Senatorshlp. Reorgan
ization meant a delay of a week at least,
and with It, it appears Mr. Burns' chances
go a-glimmering.
When the caucus was called to order
Senator Davis offered resolutions provid
ing for the complete reorganization of the
Senate. Much to the surprise of the anti-
Burns Senators, the Mexican's men sur
rendered, and aid not as much as voice
a protest against the move. This was
taken as an indication that they appre
ciated the strength of the force, against
them and the uselesshess of making a
fight. That they were still in the schem
ing business, however, developed a little
later when Senator Leavitt presented a
resolution providing for the appointment
of enough clerks to make every Burns
tout and heeler happy. It was calculated
as a very shrewd plan to assist In buying
Burns' way into the United States Sen- i
NEW YORK, Jan. 29.-Mlss Maud
Gonne the "Irish Joan of Arc. arrived
to-Say on the French line steamer La
Normandie from Havre. Miss Gonne
could say but little about her ' 'Â«Â«Â«Â«
movements In this country, beyond the
fact that she would stay a month and
then hurry back to Ireland as her time
was fully engaged there. She will ad
dress several meetings In the interest of
the Boers. .. nf
Upon the arrival of La Normandie at
the pier Miss Gonne was escorted to tnÂ«
Fifth Avenue Hotel.
"The object of my visit here.' said Miss
Gonne, "is to arouse sentiment here in
favor of the Boers. I have been In trance.
Germany and Holland, and there ha\e
heard expressions of surprise that Amer
ica was not foremost in championing tne
Boers. They are struggling for liberty,
they are fighting as you did for Independ
ence. I believe that the sentiment in ra
vor of the Boers is growing and I shall do
all In my power to fan the flame.
"Another reason that I am here Is to
cement the unity of sentiment between
the Irish In America and the Irish In Ire
land. That sentiment Is so strong now in
Dublin that they don"t dare to march the
troops down the main streets for fear of
having them hissed and assaulted, xne
present time Is the best that Ireland has
ever had to strike a blow for eedom - ftWrt
"In Ireland to-day there are only 6000
soldiers, where formerly there were 20,000.
One reason that Ireland' is not in a good
position to strike a blow is because she
had strictly followed ParneU's teachings
that liberty could be secured by parlia
mentary motions. It was said that we
could have freedom by asking and hold-
ate with the patronage that Senator Leav
itt was very generously trylns to provide
for the faithful. His scheme was so trans
parent that a blind Senator could have
seen through it and the opposition crushed
it with neatness and dispatch.
The patronage proposition created the
only argument during the caucus. On all
other matters the Burns people showed
no disposition to fight, but when there
was a chance to get both fists. Into the
public treasury they declared themselves.
At first they tried bulldozing tactics,
which proved to be of no avail. Then
they began to plead and finally almost
begged to be shown some consideration.
The only concession that was made to
them was the consent to refer the subject
to a committee, after It had been decided
that the clerkships sT-.ould be limited to
the number actually necessary to handle
the business of the Senate. Senators Da
vis; Cutter and Leavitt were appointed on
the committee. On the basis finally set
tled upon there will be no fat Jobs, and
$6 a day will be the amount of patronage
at the disposal of each of the Republican
Senators.
The anti-Burns Senators were right on
their mettle throughout the caucus, and
not satisfied with upsetting the colonel's
plans they added a little force to their
position by deciding not to take a tote on
the Senatorshlp until Tuesday of next
week.
GAGE'S REMOVAL SCHEME
PLAIN AS DAYLIGHT
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 29.â Gage's propo
sition embodied in his message to the Leg
islature wherein he seeks power to re
move appointed officers la clearly under
stood In the Senate and Assembly. It la
a rank scheme to place patronage In the
hands of the executive to be used to sus
tain Burns. As the scheme has been ven
tilated there Is no danger of Its success.
Many Senators will Jump on the measure
Immediately on Its introduction In case
the Governor can find any one with the
audacity to Introduce it.

SANTA BARBARA, Jan. 29.â The meet-

a few Democrats in attendance. The

4other flat, which was again succeeded by
a round eminence held by the Boers in
great strength.
"The ridge held by our men was iac<=-<l
by a number of strong little kopjfes at all
angles, whence the Boers sent a concen
trated fire from their rifles, supported by
a Maxim-Norilenfeldt and a big long*
range gun. What with the rifles, the ma
chine guns and the big gun. the summit
was converted into a perfect hell. The
shells exploded continually in our ranks
and the rifle fin- from an" absolutely un
seen enemy was perfectly appalling*
"Reinforcements were hurried up by
General Warren, but they had to cross a
stretch of fiat sround. which was liter
ally torn up by the flying lead of the
enemy. The unfinished trench on the
summit gave very questionable shelter, as
the enemy's machine guns were so ac
curately trained upon the place that often
sixteen shells fell in the trench in a single
minute.
"Mortal men could not permanently hold

It tenaciously for twenty-four hours, and
then, taking advantage of the dark night,
abandoned it to the enemy."
AMERICAN SYMPATHY FOR
SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLICS
NEW YORK, Jan. 29.â A mammoth pro-
Boer meeting was held to-night In the
Grand Central Palace. It was called to
express American sympathy for the South
African republics. Another object was
the raising of funds to care for the ill and
wounded within the Boer lines.
Ex-Judge George M. Van Hoesen was
the presiding officer. On the platform
were more than a hundred vice presidents
on "New York Committee to Aid the
United Republics." It was this committee
which called this meeting.
The Grand Central Palace was filled to
its capacity. The Boer, Free State and
American colors were conspicuously dis
played.
Letters of regret were read from Gov
ernor Charles S. Thomas of Colorado. E.
D. Warfleld of Lafayette College, Easton.
Pa.; Senator George L. Wellington of
Maryland and others. Senator Welling
ton was to have been one of the speakers.
He expressed sincere regret that the state
of his health v/ould not allow him to at
tend the meeting.
The first speaker of the evening was
Congressman David de Armond of Mis
souri, who, in mentioning some of the
reasons why he should sympathize with
the Boers, spoke of the causes of senti
ment. In this connection he said:
"There is no special tongue or partic
ular language that can ally us to ty
ranny. Liberty is the dream and aspira
tion, the noblest hope of all who ever
dreamed or hoped-for advancement."
Continuing, Congressman de Armond
spoke of the talk concerning the alliance
with England by the United States. The
mention of this subject was greeted with
hisses.
'"No British alliance for us," he re
marked. It was fully five minutes before
Chairman Van Housen could restore or
der. ÃBS
This speaker was followed by Congress
man Charles F. Cochran. also of Missouri.
The speaker mentioned in sarcastic tetms
the fact that England is often spoken of
as "the mother of civilization." He tl>t-n
alluded to the Boers and their fightlner
qualities, and declared that they were
now fighting the battle of humanity.
"Why should England be called the
mother of civilization?" he continue'!.
"What has she ever civilized? What has
she done for the Boers? What did sho do
for India? Now there is Alaska; there
never was any dispute about the boundary
line up there until a gold mine was dis
covered. It's the ,same way In South
Africa. This mother of civilization took
no Interest in that part of South Afr.'ca
until diamond mines were discovered.
Then this pirate nation and gold thief
stepped in and began a warfare for the
sake of civilization and liberty." * ,
The speaker referred to the battle on
Spion Kop an-I was greeted with cheers;
He said:
: "When in the agony of thinking of the
temerity of that handful of Boers going
into this battle I prayed God that they
mlght hold out long enough so that the
price of "grape' might be raised In the
London markets. There is a God who
overrules battles, and I trust that to him
It may seem well that the cause of lib
erty and not of tyranny may achieve vic
tory in this unholy war."
In conclusion Congressman Cochran
said: "Let us give the lie to the brazen
assumption that in any portion of the
United States there exists any sympathy
for this unholy crusade."
The following resolutions were unani
mously adopted:
That every nation has a right to form and
LONDON. Jan. 30. â In sharp contrast
with the eager desire for news
from the front which possessed all
London last week, yesterday's si
lence, broken only by the receipt
of the heavy list of officers and men
killed, wounded or missing, was generally
welcomed. Every one seemed to fear that
General Buller might report further par
ticulars which would show that the re
cent reverse suffered by Warren's division
was mere disastrous than previous dis
uatches had indicated.
For many days to come, in all proba
bility, there is likely to be a lull in opera
tions on the Tugeia. There Is not much
prospect of any renewal of active move
ments until communcations have passed
between General Buller and Lord Roberts
concerning the whole matter.
In regard to the future advance of the
British forces, the decision which will
have to be made Is a difficult one. On one
hand Is the obligation to relieve Lady
emith if possible, and on the other is the
apparent necessity or advisability of re
verting to the original plan of campaign
and advancing into the Orange Free State.
As the situation is viewed here all pro
gress in Natal is for the present stopped.
Ladysmith may or may not fall. It is the
prevailing opinion of continental military
critics that the Boers would be foolish to
take it and burden themselves with 10,000
prisoners when they can keep them idle
and helpless and at the same time pre
vent the concentration of a huge British
army and lure- British generals Into fur
ther entanglements and further costly
but futile attempts at relief.
As to the advance northward through
the Free State, if. as now appears prob
able, the British commander has to keep
nearly all of Buller's army on the line of
the Tugeia, a new army will have to
make the advance on Bloomfontlen. There
Is no use disguising the fact that the im
perial forces now in South Africa are not
strong enough at present to undertake
this advance with safety. One in author
ity says:
"We shall need at least 100,000 more
men. 50.000 to reinforce those at the camp
and 50.000 more as a reserve."
The seriousness of the general situation
is reflected in the comments In this morn
ing's London papers. The Daily Tele
graph says :
"It is a terrible alternative when we
have to balance against each other the
safety of the brave men in the beleagured
camp and the only rational policy of car
ryinjr on the war. It has to be faced
without sentiment or unavailing regret."
The Daily Mail says cf an advance from
Cap"? Colony:
"Such a move could not be made with
sufficient speed to save Ivadysmith^ It
would Â«eem that the soundest military
principles dictate reinforcement of our
army in Natal and a fresh advance this
time in ample force."
The Mail considers the present condition
of affairs. most critical, and says:
"There are two dangers to be guarded
againstâ foreign intervention and further
military disaster :n South Africa. To
meet the first, the whole navy should be
mobilized and th<Â» naval reserves called
out. Our squadrons should be distrib-
ceal it from ourselves. The initiative Is
now again with the Boer commander, and
the question is. v.-hat will he do next?
He will either act against Ladysmith or
against General Buller. In the latter case
pursuit would be useless, for when the
British force is once across the river
again it would be impracticable, as a
small rear guard could prevent pursuit.
Much more probable would be an attack
on Chieveley before the return of the main
body. Either that or a fresh assault on
l>adysmith may be recorded in a day or
two."
Wilkinson then proceeds to point out
the groundlessness of fears that strat
egic suggestions made in England might
be useful to the enemy. He says that the
censorship stands in the way of any
such benefit to the Boers, and that, more
over, if the Boer generals want sugges
tions they can easily get them from the
German press. As such matters are likely
to come under the attention of Parlia
ment he discusses at length questions of
artillery and the like, concluding as fol
lows :
"The measures now urgently needed are
the development of the military resources
of the country by the initiative of gov
ernment. With IOO.Or} men In the field
and 50.000 to follow, the moment has
come to push on the training of all troops
left at home and to raise further troops
to supply the further needs of the cam
paign."
BRITISH TROOPS RAKED
BY MOST FEARFUL FIRE
LONDON. Jan. 30 âA special dispatch
from Frere Camp, dated Friday, January
Â£6, ;Â»:10 p. m., says:
"I have just ridden in here, having left
General L'-uller's forces In the new posi
tions south of the Tugeia, to which they
retired in consequence of the reverse at
Spion Kop.
"The f.ghtlng. both before and after
the occupation of the mountain, was of
a desperate character. Spion Kop Is a
precipitous mountain, overtopping the
whole line of kopjes along the Upper Tu
gela. On the eastern side of the moun
tain faces Mount Alice and Potgieters
Drift, standing at right angles to the
Boer central position and Lyttelton's ad
vanced position. The southern point de
scends in abrupt steps to the lower line
of Kopjrs. On the western side, opposite
the right outposts of Warren's force It
is impassably Fteep until the point where
the nek joins the kop to' the main range.
Then there Is a gentle slope, which al
lows easy access to the summit.
"The nek was strongly held by the
Boers, who also occupied a heavy spur,
parallel with the kopje, where the enemy
was concealed in no fewer than thirty
five rifle pits and was thus enabled to
bring to bear upon the men a damaging
crossfire, the only possible point for a
British attack being the southern side
with virtually sheer precipices on the
left and right.
"A narrow footpath, admitting men
In single file only to the summit, opens

A Cabinet Minister who was interviewed
by a rerresentative of the Associated

EDITOR STEAD HAS
ADDRESSED THE COMMONS
LONDON. Jan. 29.-Mr. -William T.
Stead has addressed an open letter to the
Speaker cf the House of Commons, Mr.
William Courtgulley, asking him to bring
it. to the notice of the House. The writer
says:
"The consequence of going to war with
a lie in our right hand is now manifest
even to the dullest understanding. The
responsibility for the lie which is now
working out its natural consequences In
South Africa originally lay upon the Co
lonial Secretary alone, but by a conspir
acy of falsehoods the select committee of
IÂ£3S was hocussed into returning a false
verdict, which being afterwards accepted
by the House of Commons, involved Par
liament itself in the responsibility for a
fatal fraud."
Mr. Stead then asserts that "the war i
was undertaken to conceal the truth and ;
to whitewash the Colonial Secretary." ar.d
he appeals to the House to insist upon the [
prcduciicn of the correspondence between j
the Colonial Office and Mr. Hawksley, so- j
licitor to the Chartered Company. "In or- j

SCHOFIELD SAYS
THE BRITISH BLUNDERED
NEW YORK, Jan. 29.â 1n reply to a tel
egraphic request to-day for his views as
to the war situation in South Africa.
Lieutenant General John M. Schofield,
late commander of the army of the Unit
ed States, sends the following:
At sresent the British situation in South
Africa Is serious because of the original faulty
operation by which the force at Ladysmith be
came shut up In that place instead of joining
reinforcements coming from the rear. The re
sult may be the sacrifice of the garrison oi
Ladvsmlth. but even In that event the Boers
wit." have paid pretty dearly for their success.
The present failure to penetrate the Boer lines
was to have been expected. The British will
probably now organize a separate army, strong
enough to penetrate the Boer territory by an
other line and thus turning the Boer position
about Ladvsmlth.
But the final result Is not to be reached by ;
I capturing on* or even many positions, but -i ,
! lontc series of hard-fought battles, in which j
' superior numbers and resources ought finally i
ito prevail. It Is a battle between heroes, who
will fight It out to a finish.

HE HAD JUST A FEW
HOURS OF LIBERTY
MILITARY PRISONER ESCAPES
FROM THE PRESIDIO.
Caught Again Under a Peculiar Cir
cumstance and Sent Back to
Alcatraz.
A prisoner named George escaped from
the guard at the Presidio yesterday and
all the morning a troop of cavalry was
patrolling the streets In the vicinity ot
the Presidio and the post itself in search
of him. He was captured early in th*
afternoon by a peculiar combination of
circumstances.
George is doing a sentence of three
years for desertion. He was brought over
from Alcatraz yesterday in company with
about sixty other prisoners who are daily
brought over to work at the Presidio. Ha
was set at work digging a sewer near the
post buildings and the sentry allowed him,
to go to the rear without accompanying
him. When he went after him the pris
oner wa_s gone.
No one saw him escape and he got clear
away. He was dressed In an ordinary
brown working suit such as many of the
men wear and he passed unnoticed as far
as Van Ness avenue.
About the time George reached Van
Ness avenue it was found that a prisoner
had escaped from the guardhouse at Fort
Mason, and Immediately a guard from
Fort Mason was sent out in search of
him. George saw the men start out. and,
thinking they were after him. he took
refuge in a barn near by. the barn prov
ing to be no other than that of General
Shafter. A stableman saw him go in. am!
more to have him removed than for any
other reason he told the guard. The sol
dier proceeded to oust him. but his ac
tions aroused suspicion and he was final
ly identified as the escape from the Pr*
sidio. H# was taken to the Presidio
guardhouse at once and afterward was
sent back to Alcatraz. He will be con
fined on bread and water for ten days,
reduced from the second to the third class
and will lose all good conduct credits
coming to him.
Private Joseph L. Freeman. Troop G.
Sixth Cavalry, was the sentry In charsre
of George. He was placed under arrest
and will be tried by general court-mar
tial. It is a violation of one of the arti
cles of war to allow a prisoner to escape
and it sometimes amounts to a very seri
ous matter.
The man who escaped from Fort Mason
Is Elmer Jones, alias Frederick Wilson,
who had been arrested at the dnor of the
County Jail last Thursday on the charge
of desertion, and who was handed over
to the military authorities at Fort Masou
last Sunday.
LONDON, Jan. 30.â General Culler's operation has cost 912 men, so
far officially reported, within ten days. Applying to the 206 Spion Kop
casualties reported to-day the rule of proportion, the losses of officers
indicate there are 500 casualties yet to come. The total casualties of
the war, compiled from official figures, are 9523 â nearly a division.
Of these 2486 are killed, 4811 wounded, and the rest are prisoners.

VERY CHEAP AND DURABLE.
While waiting the other evening
for a Fi!lxnore-stre-t car on the corner
cf Sixteenth and Mission streets the
eye cf a Call representative was at
tracted by the beautifully dressed
shew-windows of the Pattosien Com
pany's big furniture store. The cor
ner window â by the way, the largest
single show window of any store in
San Franciscoâ is arranged to repre
sent a parlor. The back wall is cov
ered with an expensive Axminster
carpet, in old red coloring. It has the
effect of a rich two-tone wallpaper.
Pictures are hung on the wall and
curtains and portieres are most artis
tically draped to represent the win
dows and doors.
The fiocr is covered with the hand
somest pstt^m cf inlaid wood floor
ing ever shown in San Francisco. It
is a combination cf golden oak and
walnut, with a rich Grecian border in
the same cclorinsrs.
This new style of parquetry is
raade in thousands of designs. It is
blind nailed to the floor and no glue
is used nor do puttied up nailholes
mar the beautiful glcss of this up-to
date floor covering.
No house is so fine that parquetry
Â¦will not add to it, and no cottage is so
cheaply built that parquetry cannot
bÂ» used in it to advantage. Builders
say nothing sells a house quicker
than a handsoni- floor, architects
know nothing as effective and ex
perts recognize nothing so sanitary.
A postal card to either of the Pat

* LONDON. Jan. 30, 4:13 a. m.â History
for a time in South Africa. It is'
? one of those unsatisfactory pauses that
Lare nearly as trying to British nerves.
|Asa sequence of reverses, and apparently.
j it â¢will terminate only when Lord Roberts ,
;; ' gives the wcrd for the forward movement
finto the Free State, which, according to
most cheerful view, he will be unable'
?to do for a fortnight.
5, Whether he will permit General Buller<
"to make another attempt to relieve Lady-,
smith Is quite outside the knowledge even
r'of those closely connected with the War'
?Office. With the troops due to arrive next '
â¢month he may think himself strong
? enough to try two large operations. Com
i>bining the forces under Generals Meth-,
iuen. French and Gatacre, and adding,
I to them the arriving troops, Lord Roberts
5 would have 70,000 for the invasion of the,,
? Free State, with 40.000 to 50,000 guarding'
and f3,000 trying to res-*
t cue Ladysmith. ? : i
""- 4From the way public sentiment is tending in Great
Britain a good many of the Ministers would prob
ably as soon be in Ladysmith as anywhere else
when Parliament meets.
The next time the British take Spion Kop they will
move it out of range of the Boer guns at once. It
isn't safe where it is.
The northern line will doubtless prove so commer
cially profitable that the promoters can construct it
without having to ask a subsidy, but that is no suf
ficient reason why the other line should not be con
structed also. The land line would be subject to in
terruptions in the severe winters of the north and
might be cut in case, of wars in which either Great
Britain or Russia was engaged, but the ocean cable
r would be virtually secure at all times. Moreover

operated. What was then abandoned has now been
revived by reason of the increased need of communi
cation with A<ia, as well as with Europe and by the
development of Alaska and Siberia.
Several wise observers of things political have con
vinced themselves that the Southern Pacific Com
pany intends to reimburse U. S. Grant Jr. for the ex
penditures that did not make him a United States
Senator. Are these astute gentlemen aware that W.
F. Herrin is not the head of the claims department of
the railroad and that Huntingdon never acquired a
habit of spending money from sentiment?
Another Market-street dive has contributed another
murder to the history of local crime. Are the am
bitious, reorganized police aware that the center of
crime is not in Chinatown? Are they aware that
there are resorts in San Francisco that need suppres
sion perhaps more than highbinder societies?
Some of the men who give prestige to California
with their presence in the State Legislature are wink
ing knowingly, it is said, and saying that they have
the secret from the inside. They insist that for the
period of the extra session at least the middle name
of D. M. Burns is Mazuma or Mud.
ANOTHER YAWP FOR LIBERTY.
ABOVE the music and the roar of the marching
hosts of civilization and imperialism sounds
unexpectedly a voice demanding justice and
liberty and making sarcastic remarks about the white
man's divinely appointed mission to rule his brother
and elevate him. The voice comes from Samoa. It
is that of Malietoa Tanus and he complains of the
Americans, the British and the Germans as if they
were a pack of thieves instead of being the most en
lightened, liberal and moral people on earth.
Malietoa says the division of the Samoan Islands
between Germany and. the United States, by the
consent of Great Britain, is an outrage, a gross viola
tion of solemn treaties, an offense to the law of na
tions and a crime against humanity. He asserts that
the Americans, the British and the Germans came to
Samoa, promised fair things and received fair treat
ment. They agreed, he says, to guarantee the inde
pendence of the islands and the rights of the islanders
and in return for that guarantee received valuable con
sideration. They have now broken the agreement,
dismembered Samoa and divided it. as spoils of con
quest among themselves.
The old heathen in his rage goes so far as to de
clare that the civilization carried to Samoa by the
United States, Germany and Great Britain is not as
good as that which existed there before they came.
He even asserts that the ancient religion is better
than the new and was taught by better men. On
that delicate subject he has the impudence to say:
"The missionaries who graced our country with their
holy or unholy presence introduced the same religious
differences and hatreds against each other as per
tained at the hour in civilized states. The mission
aries live in palatial concrete houses, with all the
luxuries their countries can afford, and charge us
for Bibles and prayer books which, we understand, are
sent as free offerings."
TRANS-PACIFIC CABLE PROJECTS.
OLD-TIME wisdom, expressed in the proverb,
"It never rains but it pours," is fulfilled for
us in great enterprises as well !as in small
things. No sooner was it assured that the American
people were resolved to construct the, Nicaragua
canal than there came forth three companies, with
each a route of its own to 6upply the demand. So
also has it happened in the issue of atrans-Pacific tele
graph cable. Now that it is clear we must have a
cable, behold there are two offered to us.
The main project, that of laying a cable from some
point near San Francisco to Honolulu and from there
across the ocean to Asia, has long been under con
sideration and a bill is before Congress to provide
for it. A new scheme is now suggested and strongly
backed, that of running a wire overland to Alaska and
thence by way of the Alaskan islands to Asia and so
southward to Japan and the Philippines.
The promoters of the new enterprise make a good
offer. In a recent prospectus they say: "There are
two projects to connect North America with Asia
by means of cable. The promoters of one cable have
selected a long, roundabout, difficult route, in seas
deeper than any in which a cable has yet been laid
and through uninhabited ocean wastes. As this cable
will be very costly to build and maintain and com
mercially unremunerative and inefficient its backers
ask an annual subsidy from the United States of $400,
000. The promoters of the other cable have selected
the direct route, with commercial stations of great
importance at short intervals, the sea bottoms being
shallow and favorable and the stretches such that a
cable of the highest efficiency is easy to lay, operate
and duplicate, and its backers ask no' sub
sidy, but offer to the Government great privileges
and advantages. The long cable is via Honolulu to
Manila. The short cable is via Alaskan islands and
Japan to Manila. The promoters of the short cable
offer, to build it and in addition to lay a cable from
San Francisco to Honolulu for less than half. the cost
of the long cable via Honolulu to Manila."
The Alaskan project, while new in a certain sense,
is a revival of an enterprise that was under considera-

Replying to the questions asked us on all sides, "Will Colonel Dan Burns

special session if he hadn-t?" we wish to say that it is our emphatic belief that
Boss Burns hasn't got things fixed and we don't believe he will ever wear that

are convinced that the Burns men are simply repeating their perennial bluit _of
last winter when they claim that they have the whole works and that Burns
will be elected. For our part we are in favor of going boldly in and calling that
bluff an.i electing somebody else. Since the tremendous expense must bÂ« In
curredl there is an absolute demand that we do the work for which we are called
tne^hpr and that we do it quickly. Without a caucus Burns can hold a dead
lock till doomsday. Wkh a caucus and a majority against him the matter can
be Settled quickly. Even if Burns is knocked out In caucus he can retire in that
rool dlenlied way of his saving: "That is all I have held out for and let the v.UI
of the major lt? i govern" Governor Gage treated the members of the Legislature
mighty Shabbily in calling the extra session on so short a notice. But now that
we are compelled to be there next Monday the News favors going in w th a
vieor 'hat shall break any possible programme. There are three points to be
a mcd at T election of *a -representative Republican, the defeat of Dan Burns
and the finishing of the work without undue expense to the. State. A\ c are not
one of those who take such a pessimistic view of the situation as to say that
because opposition candidates are not thick Burns has us. \\ c think that Is an
element of strength A free field will permit the opposition to Burns to unite.
Colone Burns is not nearly m> black as he has been painted by a prejudiced,
bitter metropolitan press, vet as a political boss he has no more business to be
elected to serve this great Slate in the United States Senate than he has to rep
ro^nt us at St Peter's Judgment seat. If the Republican party must bear th s

Nebraska, in which Colonel Bryan and certain
Populist leaders met and made a treaty, in
volving a fusion this year on the Presidential ticket
and a division of the spoils. As to the latter there
is no light upon the ratio, whether 16 Democratic to 1
Populist, , but it was decided that the Populist Na
tional Convention will be held a month in advance
of any other, and it will doubtless nominate Colonel
Bryan for President. It is believed that such action
will placate the Populist vote, a large section of
which in 1896 objected to taking him second
hand after he had been nominated at Chicago. It is
expected that the Democratic taste has become so
vitiated that it will take any dose Colonel Bryan will
choose to administer.
It will be seen that this plan for fusion is familiar, j
It was followed in California in 1898. Judge Maguire
was nominated for Governor by the Populists first,
signed their platform, partook of their communion,
found a family strawberry mark on them, and then he
was taken secondhand by the Democrats, and then
he was beautifully beaten by the people. Only a
politician who believes he is a man of destiny, born
with a caul, and having a horoscope that nothing can
knock out, would follow the example of such a plan
that had such a result.
The incidents of the Nebraska conventicle were
characteristic of the spirit Bryan has put into a
politics that affects his interests. It is the spirit of
intense intolerance. His organization does not per
mit the discussion of plans or policies. It adopts them
and then excludes all who wish discussion. In the
call for the B^-an Populist meeting at Lincoln, is
sued by the Nebraska member of the Populist Na
tional Committee he said: "Those supporting
Barker and Donnelly should not be permitted to
take part in the meetings of our committee or in
the convention."
Barker and Donnelly are opposed to the commit
tee concluding the action of the convention in ad
vance of its meeting. They desire the gathering of a
free convention to discuss the policy of fusion and
of Colonel Bryan's nomination, upon which the com
mittee has already decided. Therefore because they
wish the convention to be a deliberative body, to dis
cuss principles and policy and decide after exami
nation, rather than merely record a decision already
reached by the committee, they are calmly ruled out
by Colonel Bryan's dictation, and only those who
favor his nomination and the fusion will be ad
mitted.
It is doubtful if bossism ever went to greater ex
tremes in American politics. The Populist National
Convention will meet. All opposition will be ex
cluded. Colonel Bryan will be nominated and the
country will be called to admire the unanimity of as
cription to his great talents and popularity. And ha
sits down with the Populist committee and deliber
ately plans his own nomination and indorsement
and excludes from the counsels and conventions of
the party all who oppose him!
It is strange that any man of sufficient sense to find
his own mouth with his food should expect to fool
the country by such artifices. It is perfectly well
known that California, New Jersey, Xew York and
Maryland would send to the Democratic National
Convention, under the regular call, solid gold dele
gations, opposed to the Populist fusion and opposed
to Bryan's nomination. But it is equally well known
that if this were done that convention would give
such delegations a dose of the same medicine Colonel
Bryan has prescribed for objecting Populists. They
would be excluded from the convention, just as the
Dakota, Nebraska and Michigan delegations were in
1596, and their seats would be filled, if necessary, by
men who were not candidates in the State conven
tions. So it is recognized as useless to try for a
hearing, even, in the Democratic convention. Colonel
Bryan will be nominated by the fusion, and self
respecting Democrats and Populists will see to it
that his kind of bossism is killed so dead that it will
never have an imitator.

GOOD GOVERNMENT.
S we have often insisted, it is not possible to
/ \ secure good government by the mere opera
tion of fundamental law.
Good government depends upon the uprightness
and unselfishness of those chosen to administer it
We never had confidence in the motives of Mayor
Phelan, since he has depended, from the beginning
of his public career, upon appeals to prejudice and
has never addressed an argument to the reason of his
fellow-citizens.
It is seen now that the new charter and the State
statutes have been defied and nullified by him in the
pursuit of his personal and selfish ambitions. He
sought the power of the ofnee he holds, not to up
rightJy administer it for the public good, but to build
up aa elaborate machine that would give him im
pulse and momentum toward further and what he
considers higher office-
This does not rest on what we say. The proof is
furnished by his supporters and not his opponents.
That he bartered the once of Chief of Police for
votes is established by his own admissions and in the
defense made for him by his organ, the Examiner.
That defense is in the characteristic shape of an at
tack on Senator Biggy, in which that gentleman is
subjected to a lot of pinto blackguardism and is ac
cused of treachery to Phelan in his refusal to sup
port Esola. That tells the whole story. It reveals
the cat escaping from the bag, and the African con
cealed in the woodpile. Mayor Phelan expects his
appointees to the independent commissions provided
by the new charter to redeem his ante-election prom
ises given to the Examiner push, and a failure is
treated as treason to the lord Mayor. It would be
equally a violation of official propriety and the purity
of elections law if the Mayor had involved himself
in a promise to use his official power to make the
fittest nian in the city Chief of Police. His effort to
make the enfittest Chief is all this and has added to it
the grossest public immorality.
It is well tnat in the first administration under the
new charter the people get this lesson. Phelan him
self in advocating the charter pursued a course cal
culated to inculcate a feeling of dependence upon the
instrument itself for good government The people
in his methods have been furnished an excellent ex
fcrcple of what to avoid in future elections and the final
effect upon local government will be good.

SEA AND LAND POWER.
ONE of ttic extraordinary incidents of the war
against the South African republics is a let
ter written by Captain A. T. Mahan of the
navy, chiding Americans for expressions of sympathy
with the Boers. In this epistle Captain Mahan says:
"There arc very many among us, myself certainly one,
who feel as strongly in favor of Great Britain as
others do of her opponents. Let us all be careful not
to provoke- one another by immoderate expressions
of opinions to which public meetings tend. Those
en one side provoke retaliation on the other side.
In the problems of the near future good understand
ing with Great Britain is too important for us to per
mit the impression that we are all against her here,
and we may find ourselves in an unseemly state of
party division for and against foreign states, as in
the beginning of this century between the French and
British parties. I avail myself of this opportunity to
say that, in my judgment, not only is the cause
of Great Britain just, but to have failed to uphold it
would have been to fail in national honor."
Perhaps Captain Mahan in his certainty of the high
authority of his own opinion fails to see that his is the
most irritating utterance yet heard in the whole af
fair. He deprecates division on the subject, at the
same time claiming the right to advise the suppres
sion of all public expressions adverse to his own
limitless championship of Great Britain! Nothing is
better calculated to cause extreme expressions than
his ill-advised letter. He declares that it is wrong to
be divided in opinion for and against foreign states!
Had he put his case as against any expression in the
affairs of foreign states he would have had some
standing in reason, which he now entirely lacks.
Captain Mahan is the author of a very able work
on "Sea Power," the possession of which he regards
as necessary to national life, and primacy in which,
possessed by any nation, makes it the dictator of the
v.-orld. Perhaps he sees his theory in danger in the
success of the South African republics. If Great
Britain fail in her aggression upon them her influ
ence wanes, notwithstanding her primacy of the seas.
Like all theories based upon the utility of unthink
ing force, Captain Mahan's may be examined to its
detriment. Its analogue was the senior theory that
the ownership of land power in the form of the great
est armies was a necessary guarantee of national life.
All of the empires and experiments at empire,
from Babylon to Bonaparte, were based on that theory
and they all failed and fell. The professional advo
cates of the righteousness of might now fallback upon
the sea. as history has driven them from the land. Aside
from the academic discussion of this theory, the
American people have always sympathized with the
effort of any others to establish and sustain repub
lican government. We have gone further than this.
We have even sympathized with those who by brave
revolution have sought a change of dynasty in the
hope and expectation of bettering themselves in
their material condition. Instinctively, then, Amer
icans are for the Boers. In this they stand with Bryce
and Go!dv.-m Smith, and the philosophers and thinkers,
to whom England is indebted for a fame that will
outlive her conquests and survive her empire. They
are stung, therefore, by such chiding as comes from
the author of "Sea Power." Amongst them are those
as well qualified as he to judge of the righteousness
of England's pretensions in South Africa, and they
resent, with proper spirit, his judgment of what con
stitutes the national honor of Great Britain and our
obligation to uphold it as if we were subjects of the
crown. His letter is untimely and unfortunate and
republican America is sorry that it was written at all.
It will produce a contrary effect to that which he
intended. If he think that the public meetings of
Americans, expressing sympathy with the Boers, pro
voke those who hold with him to retaliate, he is at
liberty to proceed with retaliation. Halls are open for
the cost of the rent and meetings to sympathize with
Great Britain in the destruction of republics will be
treated with all tolerance.
there is never any great harm done by competition
in telegraphy and to the public two cables are very
likely to prove cheaper than one.

AN INFORMAL
GOLF DANCE
Nine Young Ladies Enter

Nine young ladles, members of the Pa.i

dance last evening In their clubrooms cut
at the Presidio. It was an informal af

as entertainments of such a nature a.*

The dancers, one hundred In number.
took possession of the two bright, pret'.y
living rooms of the club, which for tht
occasion were artistically decorated wlsn
ferns and huckleberry vines. The lunch
room was made to do duty as a supper
room, and there a delicious menu was
discussed between the dances.

were: Miss Mary Scott, Misa Cora Sme4

McÃean. Mlia Carrie Taylor. MiS3
Oenevieve Carolan and Miss Al
ice Hoffman. Although the affair wÂ«
given by devotees of the Scotch game and
the rooms of the club did duty for a rial
room, there wan nothing suggestive of the
"Hoot, mon" about the dance. The ladles
wore regulation ball gowns and tha gen
tlemen the usual dress society demands at
an evening? function.
If there la any manhood In thÂ» San

seem natural that they should arise,
throw off the yoke and place some man of
ability in the Police Department who is

natural to expect some fire, whether It
comes to light or not.

XIVâ GILBERT STUART.
Details of the life of Gilbert Stuart, the
greatest of the early American painters
and surely one of the most remarkable
of the art products of this country, are
singularly lacking. He left behind him al
most no papers but a few letters and
practically no data upon which to build
up a biography. One is obliged to turn
to personal anecdotes from some of his
old friends and patrons, and the memo
ries of his daughter Jane, to get an idea
of the man. This daughter was an esti
mable lady In every respect, but she had
only a limited notion of the larger side
of her father's life and no sense of humor,
and with her the commonplaces took on a
proportion quite beyond their value. So
it is after all by his works alone that Stu-
him famous. Fairly overrun with com
niasions. so great was his popularity. In
jrder to work with something like tran
quillity he subsequently moved out to
Germantown. However, he had found
time in Philadelphia for social gayety.
contributing himself with his sprightly
taik and his music in no small measure
to the success of the entertainments, and
he paintftl such important personages as
Mrs. Washington. Mrs. ningham. tha
Marchioness d'Yrujo. Mrs. Madison, Mrs.
Lawrence Lewis and many others.
From Philadelphia Stuart went to
Washington in ISO 3. and after three years*
residence there he removed to Boston,
where he remained until his death.
Through all these later years he was still
as improvident as ever and careless In all
matters relating to his personal affairs.
When the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine
Arts WTote offering him $1500 for a full
length of Washington he never even an
swered the letter; and to a request from
GILBERT STUART.
art's memory will always be kept greenâ
and what more could an artist ask? His
name ever will be associated primarily
with the Washington portraits he painted
âtheir name was legionâ and his canvases
command great respect everywhere, for
he was a portrait painter of a high order,
unquestionably the best of all Americans.
Gilbert Stuart was born on December 3,
1755, near Newport, in Narragansett Coun
ty, Rhode Island. His father kept a mill
for grinding snuff, which he gave up later,
moving with his family to Newport, where
his son went to school and received a fair
education. Like most great artists, Gil
bert bad at an early age an Intuition for
drawing; he covered barn doors and walls
with his sketches. These were subse
quently seen by an English physician, who
took a lively Interest In the lad and fur
nished him with his first paints and
brushes. At 13. without having had any
Instruction, Stuart was painting portraits,
his earliest commission being for Jo.ia
Bannister and wife of Newport, persons
who were prominent socially. The can
vases are still preserved. In 1770 for the
first time In his life he had the help of
some one more or less qualified to advise
him intelligentlyâ a Scotch artist named
Cosmo Alexander, who settled for two
years in Newport. On Alexander's return
to England Stuart accompanied him.
Unfortunately, the trip was not a suc
cess. Stuart painted a few portraits and
found a patron who sent him for a while
to the University of Glasgow. The pa
tron died shortly after befriending the
artist, and Stuart, finding it difficult to
make a livelihood, took passage back to
America, happily to find Instant encour
agement, particularly among the wealthy
Jews of Rhode Island. Realizing his lack
of preliminary training, together with a
friend named Waterhouse he secured mod Â¦
els and studied in the evening, drawing
from the nude. With the troublous times
of 1775 sitters ceased to come to his studio,
business was at a standstill and Stuart
made up his mind to return to England,
there to , become a pupil of Benjamin
West. That old Pennsylvanlan was set
tled in London enjoying the favor cf the
King and the patronage of the nobility.
In 1792 West succeeded Sir Joshua Rey
nolds as president of the Royal Academy.
West was one of the kindliest of men.
with gracious manner and much personal
charm, and although he was an indiffer
ent painter It Is probable that he- made
an excellent teacher. At any rate Stuart
at the age of 22 was domiciled in his fam
ily and, under his tuition, studying hard.
A musician as well as an artist, Stuart
in his odd moments had learned to play
on several instruments. He was an ex
cellent performer on the organ, and he
helped himself out in a financial way by
playing that Instrument in a London
church. About this time he painted a
portrait of the Duke of Northumberland,
and he assisted his master on many of
his large compositions, for West had a
way of painting enormous historical and
mythological pictures, covering many
square yards of canvas, the value of
which, unfortunately for the memory of
West, has not increased with time. He
was also attending the discourses of Sir
Joshua Reynolds, studying anatomy with
the famous Dr. Cruikshank and drawing
during the evening at the life school, for
he was always a man with great capacity
for work. Nathaniel Dance, the well
known portrait painter, became- interested
In Stuart's work, and noting Its excel
lence strongly advised him to take a
studio and set up for himself. This he
did, and among his first sitters were Ben
jamin West and Sir Joshua Reynolds,
who helped him into Immediate note, for
at once he became successful. He entered
at once on a life of extravagance, and,
although the money flowed In rapidly, it
disappeared quite as fast. He not infre
quently had six sitters In a day. In 1756
he married a Miss Coates and later took
her to Ireland, where he had many por
trait engagements, and was no less suc
cessful than he had been in London. It
had been his strong desire for many years
to paint an Important portrait of Georsre
Washington, so now, unable to resist this
inclination, in the midst of a highly pros
perous career In Dublin he packed up his
effects and sailed for America, landing In
New York In 1792.
He who had gone away a poor lad to
seek his fortune had now come back a
successful man with a European reputa
tion, and Immediately he. was besieged
with patrons. He entertained liberally;
he was foolishly extravagant; he had no
Idea of business, . and again the money
went out perhaps even more quickly than
It came in. Meanwhile he had taken care
to obtain a letter of Introduction to
Washington from John Jay, and Congress
then being In session he went to Phila
delphia to meet the great patriot. A
house was secured on the corner of Fifth
and Chestnut streets, and there It was he
painted the first of his series of many
Washington portraits, destined to make
the Academy of Florence for bis own por
traitâa great distinction, by the wayâ ho
paid no attention. In I<C3 his health began
to fail, but he worked on intermittlngly.
completing a portrait of Mrs. Samuel Hay
ward, his last work, in the spring of tha
year IS2J*. He died on July 27 of this year,
at the age of 72. He had a curious dispo
sition; at times he was ;he most charming
of men; at others rough and irritable.
He made many enemies and even alienat
ed friends who knew the real warmth of
his heart; without the slightest cause hÂ«
would abandon a picture, and nothing, not
even a woman's tears, could induce him
to continue; although a wonderful money
maker, he died poor, leaving bis family
entirely unprovided for.
Stuart's first portrait of Washington cre
ated a genuine sensation in Philadelphia.
It was followed by the celebrated full
length, a commission from the Marquis of
Lansdowne, which is known as the "Lana
downe portrait." It is now owned by a
Mr. Lewis In London; it was exhibited at
the Centennial in Philadelphia in ISTd by
courtesy of the owner. Of this, as of many
other of his Washington portraits. Stuart
made numerous replicas. The greatest of
Stuart's portraits rs known as the Gibbs-
Charming portrait, originally painted in
1795 for Colonel George Gibba; it was sold
io his sister, Mrs. William Ellery Chan
fning. and is now owned by her son. Dr.
Charming. Still another famous work is
known as the "Athenaeum portrait." of
which the artist made about fifty replicas.
The canvas was purchased of Stuart's
widow and presented with its pendant of
Mrs. Washington to the Athenaeum. Boa
ton, hence Its title. It is now in the Bos
ton Museum of Fine Art 3.
In Stuart'a day the standard for tha
American painter was practically that set
by Sir Joshua Reynolds; his was the pre
vailing style of work in London, and Sir
Joshua's manner was a good one to fol
low, or at least.-by which to be influenced,
for he was a man with a fine color sense.
a portrait painter of the first class, anrt
generally well equipped in all the tech
nique of his profession. Ruskin. calling
him the "prince of portrait painters."
places him among the seven great color
ists of the world; his work may be de
scribed as that of the older masters seen
through a fine personality and lnterpreteil
In an Individual way. There Is no such
thing as originality pure and simple in
art, for If the inspiration be not directly
traced to some previous master, then It
Is nature that has given the hint, or in
some way,directed the channel of thought.
In the style of most men. If the search
Is continued long and carefully enough,
one may find the mainspring of the in
fluence, and this holds true in the. history
of all races; the one took from the other,
improving possibly, perfecting, or amal
gamating, until the original was very
nearly lost; but the source to the student
is discoverable all the same. So we may
find in the portraits of Stuart the lama
qualities that permeated those of Rey
nolds, seen through a sturdy, vigorous In
dividuality.

ing at a forge but a few moments before
the explosion. The presumption is he was
thawing out a stick of dynamite. The
body was horribly disfigured, parts be
ing found a considerable distance from the
scene of the accident. The building near
by, which has been occupied as a bunk
house by the men employed at the quarry,
was badly demolished.
Coroner Crowe has taken charge of the
remains and brought them to Redwood
City, where an inquest will be held to
morrow. Deceased was a native of Cali
fornia, aged id years and unmarried.

WONZOD IS ACQUITTED.
Jury Recognizes His Right to Defend
TTia Waffles.
John F. Wonzod, . a Cliff House mer
chant, has been exonerated by a Jury In
Judge Cook's court for his alleged offense
In pulling a gun and tremblingly present
ing it in defense of his honor when Jen
nie Cohen said he put sand in his waffles.
After pulling the gun to defend the repu
tation of his waffles Wonzod was arrested
and charged with an assault with a dead
ly weapon. After various witnesses had
testified to the facts of the alleged as
sault, none of whom could swear that
the weapon was loaded. Judge Cook said
it was strange that the defendant had
been held to answer and ordered the Jury
to acquit the defendant, which was done.

DESPONDENT GRIPMAN
ASPHYXIATED BY GAS
MARTTX H. MORRIS, a gripman era
ployed on the Cliff and Ferries road,
residing with his family at 2750 A
Bush street, committed suicide Sun
day night by asphyxiating himself with
illuminating gas. Before he came to this
city he was engaged in farming near
Benicia, and when he left to engage in
the mere monotonous occupation of a
gripman, a friend of his was indebted to
him for a large sum of money. The de
ceased was very despondent over financial
matters, and was very much disappointed
because of his failure to collect the sum
due him. At 11 o'clock on Sunday night
he told his wife that he was going out for
a walk. That was the last she saw of
him alive.
At 8 o'clock yesterday morning his wife
detected a strong odor of gas coming from
the direction of the parlor, and found the
dead body of her husband there. Both
gas jets were turned on full force.
It is believed that Morris had a suicidal
taint in his blood, a brother of his having
committed suicide several years ago.
The deceased was a native of California,
32 years old. He left a widow and a two
and a half year old baby.

CATHOLICISM THE

ADDRESS BY THE BEY. FATHER
YOBKE.
Y. Iff. I. Lecture Series 3>raws Large
Crowd to Metropolitan Temple.
Hundreds Turned Away
From the Boors.
Rev Peter C. Yorke delivered the first
of the new series of Y. M. I. lectures last
evening at the. Metropolitan Temple. The
hall was crowded to Its greatest capacity
and hundreds were turned away from the
doors. Theodore J. Savage, president of
the lecture bureau, Introduced Father
Yorke, who was bailed with cheers and
long prolonged applause. He character
istically remarked that the people were
putting the encore at the wrong end of
the lecture. Then he paid a compliment
to the Young Men'B Institute for provid
ing the lectures. The Institute had orig
inated the idea of the lectures, he said,
when there were people who were willing
to proscribe a large portion of the com
munity because of their conscientious ad
herence to their ancient faith. That time
had passed but the lectures still had their
uses. Bigotry was not ended. A storm
had passed, but any breath might again
waken another, even as the surface of the
ocean was stirred by any gale. The lec
tures had the useful purpose of instruct
ing the great body of non-Catholics con
cerning the real facts of Catholicism-
Father Yorke then spoke on the subject
"Catholicism, the Church of the Ages."
He was frequently interrupted as he be
came more eloquent. He said the church
came to the civilization of Rome and
Greece and said to them that it had a
message they must hear; one upon which
all civilization must depend. They
laughed in scorn, proud of their legions,
of their government, of their learning.
They had passed away. All that now
remained of what then existed was the
then despised church. At various times
in the history' of the world the nations,
Germanic and French, had become proud
and had derided the church. What was
known as Protestantism had survived
about 300 years; but from Its 1000 sects
came discordant voices. The church had
been the same. It was adapted to ancient
times; It Was adapted to the present; it
was the church of the ages.
On the stage were many clergymen and
officers of the Y. M. I. Professor Harri
son played the organ at the beginning
and end of the exercises.

MAYOR PHELAN
WINS HIS FIGHT
FOR PATRONAGE
Supervisors Remove
Five Clerks.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
finally submitted to the dictates of Mayor
Phelan regarding patronage in the office
of the clerk of the board, and as a con
sequence five employes felt the keen edge
of the ax in order to make room for Phe
lan's favorites. The board met in secret
caucus immediately before the regular
session and Charles Fay, who represents
Phelan in affairs political, was busy
handing out a little typewritten slip con
taining the names of those slated for the
official plums. The elate was broken,
however, in one instance, that of James
Donahue, who was selected to succeed F.
J. Silvey as requisition clerk. There was
some hitch on this name and Silvey was
permitted to remain temporarily.
Several Supervisors held out for the re
tention of the old office force In its en
tirety on the ground of efficiency, but
they were overruled by a majority of
their brethren. The resolution providing
for the official decapitation does away
with the services of John Hamill J. S.
Thompson, George Phelps, John Elliott
and J. R. Klrby. It is as follows:
Resolved, That all positions In the office of
the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors be de
clared vacant, and that the following persons
be appointed at the salaries named: John A.
Russell, clerk, $300 per month; C. E. Williams,
expert, 5175 ; assistant clerksâ John H, Ryan,
John S. Bannermann, Thomas B. McGinniss
and John E. Behan, at 1150 per month each; P.
H. McKenna, John Llnehan and F. J. Silvey
at $125 per month each; sergeant-at-orms, R.
\\\ Anderson, $100 per month.
Stephen Potter was also slated for the
lucrative position of stenographer for the
investigations to be pursued by the board
in regard to water and gas rates, but
there was a legal defect in the ordinance
creating the position. Some argument re
sulted and Clerk Russell Inadvertently
read the name of the slated individual,
which somewhat embarrassed the Mayor,
though he 'smiled feebly at Russell's slip
of the tongue.
The Finance Committee was directed to
report to the board at the next meeting
regarding the issuance of bonds voted for
at the recent elections, so that the Issu
ance may be hastened. At Supervisor
Reed's suggestion it was decided to re
quest the City Attorney to bring a test
suit condemning ono lot on the proposed
panhandle, to decide the validity of the
bond issue.
The board adopted a resolution request
ing the City Attorney to prepare an ordi
nance repealing the first division of sub
division 48, section 10, order 1559, relating
to nickel-in-the-slot machines and impos
ing licenses thereon. The specific clause
recommended for repeal by the License
and Order Committee is that which
provides for a license on card machines.
The committee holds that these machines
are games of chance and should be sup
pressed.
Resolutions authorizing the purchase of
four horses for the Almshouse and two
for the Coroner by the chairman of the
Health Committee provoked considerable
discussion. Supervisor Reed held that the
theory of the charter was to separate leg
islative and executive functions. He said
that the resolution was in direct conflict
with section 1, chapter 111, providing that
all contracts for supplies not otherwise
specifically provided for must be made by
the Supervisors with the lowest bidder.
The adoption of the resolution was post
poned until after the Health Committee
has considered It.
The following resolutions were adopted
and provide:
That the clerk of the board be directed to
Insert In all advertisements for proposals a
clause requiring every person to whom a con
tract Is awarded to pay the cost of advertising.
That the City Attorney be authorized to pub
lish the summons in the euit of the city
against Victor Albouze et al. for the condemna
tion of property to be acquired for the pro
posed St. Marys Square.
That the Committee on Printing and Salaries
be directed not to approve any demands for
stationery or printing that contain the name
ot the head of the department.
That the Judiciary Committee consult with
the Mayor for the purpose of selecting styles
of seals for the several departments and of
fices as provided in the charter.
The following petitions were referred to
committees:
From the Bookbinders Protective and Bene
ficial Association, submitting a copy of a reso
lution adopted by it requesting that no bids
on bookbinding or on supplies in which book
binding is Involved be awarded to firms who
do not pay union or fair rates of wages, stating
that at present all the employing bookbinders
pay such rates with one exception.
From merchants requesting that the ordin
ance Imposing a license of BO cents a quarter on
telephone instruments be so constructed that
It will not Impose a tax upon private telephone
Instruments. â¢

mission to reattach its automatic gas regula

RETRENCHMENT NECESSARY
IN ALL DEPARTMENTS
MAYOR ADVISES CITY OFFI
CIALS TO ECONOMIZE.
At a conference held yesterday be
tween the Mayor and the city officials,
in the Mayor's office, his Honor made
the startling announcement that the mu
nicipal government would come to a
standstill before the end of the fiscal year
unless the various departments reduced
their expenses.
"We axe confronted with a deficit of
$139,000 for the first six months of the
present fiscal year," said the Mayor, "and
It is Incumbent upon all officials so to reg
ulate their expenditures as to make up
I,hat deficit This meeting has been
called for the purpose of impressing
upon you gentlemen the necessity of with
drawing all requests for extra help, as the
finances will not admit of those requests
being granted."
Upon the Mayor Inviting the officials to
express their desires. Dr. Williamson,
president of the Board of Health, stated
that his department could not get along
with less than $50,000 for the next clx
months. The Mayor looked blank at this
announcement and remarked that the
usefulness of the department might have
to be curtailed.
Assessor Dodge complained that he had
to get along with $13,000 less than last
year, and that he absolutely needs at
least seventy-five extra clerks for his of
fice from March 1. He deplored the fact
that the $IS.OOO for commissions on poll
tax collections has been taken away from
him, and thought that the salaries of ex
tra deputies should be paid out of those
moneys.
Chief Sullllvan said the Fire Depart
ment had become demoralized owing to
the uncertainty of Its reorganization, as
provided by the charter. The Mayor said
It would cost $40,000 to place the depart
ment on a paying basis, and the money
was not in sight. It was a question
whether the number of flre houses should
be cut down or reorganization postponed,
but Chief Sullivan declined to express an
opinion. He said the force in the truck
companies had already been cut from
twelve to ten men and the engine houses
from five to three.
County Clerk Deane declared that the
lowest he could run his office for was
$7050 a month. The charter allowed him
forty-five men and he had applied for
eleven more. To a question of the Mayor
whether the charter framers had consult
ed him with regard to the needs of the of
fice. Deane said they had not and had
probably studied the conditions as they
existed twenty years ago. It developed
that former County Clerk Flynn, now de
ceased, had advised the charter framers,
and he held the office fifteen years ago.
Recorder Godchaux wanted extra clerks,
and Tax Collector Scott made an appeal
for five or six men during April, when the
busy time is on. Scott suggested that ef
forts be made for the State to pay the
expense of the collection of the taxes by
the city and It was decided to hold a con
sultation with tne State Controller.
Sheriff Lackmann asked for two extra
guards, so that the prisoners could culti
vate the thirty acres of land owned by the
city near the branch Jails. He stated that
he had only $20 65 with which to feed Ju
rors in criminal cases and that he must
decline to assume any personal responsi
bility in the matter. Lackmann suggested
a rejief in the $200,000 appropriated for
street sweeping. The matter will be in
quired into.
The best report came from the School
Board. It Bhowed that the old board had
left a surplus of $10,000 and this would be
increased to $30,000 by the end of the fis
cal year.
It was decided to postpone the con
tracts for stationery and supplies until
the next fiscal year, and the provision of
the charter regarding the expenditure of
$200 for those purposes with the consent
of the Mayor will be Invoked.
Assessor Dodge stated that the esti
mated revenue of the city might fall short
on account of protested taxes and the
necessity for retrenchment in all depart
ments was again strongly urged by the
Mayor.
CITY ATTORNEY'S OPINION.
Board of Supervisors Enlight
ened as* to Its Powers.
A number of opinions were filed with
the Board of Supervisors yesterday by
City Attorney Lane:
In regard to the power of the board to grant
privileges for alterations and repairs to build
ings, the supervision of which is conferred on
the Board of Public Works, and for granting
permits to erect engines and boilers, the City
Attorney holds that the Board of Supervisors
under the ordinances now in force has the
power to grant such permits and that It is
within the power of said board to pass an or
dinance under which the power of issuing per
mits may be placed in the hands of the Board
of Public Works under certain general restric
tions.
As to the validity of all contracts entered
Into by former boards, the time of which has
not exDired. there is no question whatever
that the city and county is liable for all debts
legitimately contracted under its previous form
of government.
The provisions of the charter authorize the
Board of Supervisors to pay fines collected on
conviction of persons charged with cruelty to
animals In whole or In part "to any society that
efficiently aids In such convictions. But this
was not the law prior to the taking effect of
the charter, and the moneys now held under
the old act of 1574 must be paid to the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
which was organised under the act.
Whenever the board takes a step which is in
tended to bind the city and county or to be
expressive of Its lawmaking or Judicial powers,
the ayes and noes must be called whether the
proposition voted upon takes the form of a
resolution or a bill.
As to the validity of the contract for public
advertising now existing between the city and
the Evening Post newspaper, the City Attor
ney holds that a comparison of the contract
with the terms of the charter discloses such
radical differences between the two as to pre
vent any possibility of utilizing the contract
to serve the purposes of the charter provisions.
It seems Incumbent on the board to adopt an
official newspaper In accordance with the char
ter provision. Ordinances published in the
present official paper would be of doubtful va
lidity, and no important legislation ahould be
attempted In that manner. It will, however,
be proper and valid to make publications for
bids to secure a city official paper in the
Gvenlng Post.

NEW YOUK. Jan. 29.â The New York stock
market continued to view with equanimity the
disturbance In the London market on account

conditions on the exchange there, which cables

declines here i;i international stocks did not ex
c<h-4 fractions, and thTc was no iiresnure to
Â«<ll outside that for foreign account. The buy
inirrty local traders proved sufficient to absorb
Uita and to advance prices to Saturday's clos

UiÂ« rest cf the day was exceedingly sluggish,
and the o>alinrs were narrow and professional.
The indoetrial specialties continued to lead in

its cuiÃiKuur was small on account of the paucity

This irarket advanced again on call. â¢
Chicago advanced on better foreign advices,
war news and small world's shipments of
6,300,000 bushels, of which Russia shipped only
300,000. The market was nervous, and at first
was weaker, with considerable realizing and
foreigners selling freeely. Later on the for
eigners showed disposition to buy, and there
was brisk inquiry from the Continent. The
vcaboard bought heavily, but St. Louis soM
l'rcely. Chicago operators sold, but there was
n-> pittmire on the market. The visible supply
fiecreafed 957,000 bushels. Broomhall reported
that the plague in the Argentine was Interrupt-
In* railroad transit and that heavy shipments
from that country were accordingly not ro be
expected. The Echo Agricole says that official
reports indicate a French crop of 21,000.000
bushels less than last year.

dend action before the close. The other metal
etocks were nrm In sympathy. Glucose Sugar
made a show of strength on the Judicial deci
sion against the constitutionality of the Illinois
antl-trubt law.
A drop cf two points In Denver and Rio
Grande preferred was unexplained by any news
of the day. With the exception of these special
movements the market continued near the level
of stagnation. Several incidents of the day
point to the financial outlook as the true ground
of hesitation in the speculative world. Specu
lators do not forget that it was the industrial
and commercial activity of the country which
encroached on the funds they had embarked
in speculation in December, and they are
watching for the future rate of activity of
business to define Itself before availing them
eelevs of the present ease of money, which, it
is feared, may prove illusory and ephemeral.
Offerings of mercantile paper at present are
light, but this Is explained as being due to
the employment by large mercantile houses ot
the year's prollts as working capital. The
sharp upward couree of sterling exchange to
day gives point to the apprehension that gold
wiii again so out to help supply England's
need for war expenditures. An official of the
Imperial Bank of Germany quoted to-day at
tributes the ease in the German market to an
artificial maneuver to prepare the market for
municipal loans, and the same authority as
serts mat Russia Is to assert a loan. The fu
ture contingencies In the money market thus
foreshadowed may help to explain the per
sistent indifference of speculators to the present
abundance of funds.
The bond market lapsed into dullness to-day
and price changes were mixed. Total sales, par

Wheat and Wool in Australia.
According to recent estimates of the Aus
tralian wheat crop there will be an exportable
surplus of 23,000.Â©rt0 bushels, which le far in
advance of that of the season of IC9S-1?99.1 C 9S-1?99. The
last crop has been estimated at 51.000.000
bushels, against a yield of 55.770,0<"i0 bushels for
last year. There is also reported a corre
sponding decrease In the wool clip: last year's
clip Â»-as 1.G65.000 bales, but the drought of this
reason has cauwed considerable damage, lessen
ing the dip by 75,000 to 100.000 bales.
Fruit and Salmon in England.
The poÂ«!tlÂ°a of California fruits Is fairly
well defined by the fact that the arrivals per
the CenteÂ»simÂ«. have not produced any ap
preciable offers of goods on the market, and
the inference is that the whole of this first
shipment Is required for actual Immediate use.
Indications, therefore, point to the market be
ing a strong one for the new season's goods.
There is a good inquiry for salmon on the
spot and also for salmon to arrive at full
rates, and indications point to an advance in
j.ricea at no distant period. The old Etocks
are prartii-ally cleared off and the carry-over
from IK<& is said to be the smallest ever known
in the history of the trade, and this, combined
with the fact that arrivals are well distributed
over the year, tends to strengthen the position
of the article. The exceedingly hl Â« h Prices of
all kinds of tinned meats, which will doubt
less continue as long as the war in South
Africa lasts, renders salmon the cheapest
tinned food to be had.
The Prune Association.
HOW IT IS REGARDED IN THE EAST
The New York Commercial says: "The prune
growers are said to have succeeded In effecting
an organization on the coast. The details are
nÂ«.t at hand. but. to far as Information has
been received, it is said to be upon substan
tially the E&me llr.es as the raisin growers'
organization. That sat the intention and tel
egraphic information tcnit to substantiate this
vtew of it. The trade there d'jesn't appear
to be much interested, alleging that the in
terests involved are too l^rge and the territory
to be covered too large; but it will be remem
l>erÂ»*d that they *aid Mjl>Â£lantiaUy the same
thing of the raisin Interests, but they have
paid the bills ever since. The same result is
ii'it Impossible now."
In a later issue the same paper save: "The
prur.e growers' combine will not affect the
market this year, because fruit is practlcaully
out of first hands, but that it will be an im
portant factor In next season's contracts is
conceded, provided it can be made to hold
together, something which is seriously doubt
ed by those suppptted to be in a position to
know something of the probabilities of suc
ce?s. Others are equally certain that it is a
euccetm alrt-ady. and are beginning to specu
late upon the oullook for next season's busi
nÂ»-tÂ« with such an organization in control of
the eltuation. There has been no change In
prices, and so far as can i>e learned no in
crease la the volume of trade since last re
port*."

NEW YORK, Jan. 19. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here opened 'very flat to-day on
the r.ews of the retreat of General Buller
across the Tugela River. Dealers were afraid
t> buy anything, but speculation has been so
attenuated recently that comparatively few
tales resulted from the nominal prices first
given out. There was little or no buylns on
the way up. Unless Investors become panlc-
Ftrirken it would seem that the markets are
merely paralyzed. A late rumor on the board
had It that the War Office confirmed the re
ports of the relief of Mafeking. Consols ruled
one point down at 99%.
Americans had the worst opening, but the
free support from New York brought about a
rubstantial rally. The bank lost Â£15,000 gold
to India and received Â£9000 from Australia.
Money was still stagnant. Bills were easy,
a good many American bids being in the mar
ket.
London papers are being withheld. Foreign
rates were: Paris checks. 25.17; Berlin, 20.15.

TUESDAY, -JANUARY 30.
CHICAGO. Jan. 29.â The wheat market
opened strong and active. May %@%c Improved
from Saturday at 68%<g694c. The strength was
due to the Liverpool advance and the cold
weather. The English grain center showed the
effect of the email world's shipments last week
and the British reverses on the Tugela. Liv
erpool, however, lost part of her early ctiin
and the advance met heavy selling. The mar
ket declined rapidly to 68%@%c, where the de
mand improved. Influencing a reaction wMch
carried May to 68% c. For a time trade was
quiet and fluctuations narrow around that fig
ure. Near the end of the session it was an
nounced that the European visible Srnd de
creased 1.900,000 bushels, the English 767,300 and
the American 938,000 bushels and under this in
fluence the market advanced actively. May
touched 69% c and closed strong, 1c over Satur
day,, at 69%(ff69',ic. New York reported that
Liverpool acceptances during the last half hour
of the session had been large. Foreigners were
good buyers here.
The corn market was quiet and easy the
greater part of the session, but near the :nd
the strength of wheat succeeded In steadying
the market. May closed a shade over Satur
day at 33Â®33%c.
In the oats market trade was quiet, with
hardly any fluctuations. May closed V t c higher
at 23%@23%c
The provision market opened firm and higher
on receipts of hogs under the estimate and
stronger prices at the yards. The demand was
slack, however, and the market turne-1 heavy
and closed easy. May pork closed 2%5J5c under
Saturday, May lard 5@7%c down and May ribs
5c lower.

husband to a niece of Mrs. Harris, was
appointed executor, and he related in

sealed envelope from his father, Edmund
S. Churchill, a Napa banker. The elder
Mr. Churchil corroborated his son's state
ment and said he received the will In a
package In December, IS9S, a letter accom
panying It from Mrs. Ann Harris. This
letter was made public for the first time
to-day. It reads:
My Dear Mr. Churchill: Please find inclosed
my will. Kindly take charge of it and deliver
It to your son, E. Wilder Churchill, after my
<3<Â»ath Having had Â«o much trouble with my
brother Josiah, I desire my win shall be in
fafe hfinds. Having done so much for him I
am determined he shall have no more.

administered upon would amount to near-
Iv $200 000. but it appears from testimony
taken to-day that Mrs. Harris disposed
of most of her property by deed prior to
her death, leaving only about $1000 in per
sonal effects and a J60.000 judgment ob
tained against her brother, Josiah P.
Ames, recently. Her property she left to
the children of her other brother. John

NETW TORK. Jan. 23.-Robert FitEslm
mons now proclaims that he was drug
ged when he was whipped by James
Jeffries for the championship of the
world at Coney Island last June.
Fltzsimmoris says that the drug was
gircn to him in water which he drank
â¢luring the early part of the fight, and
That he has no recollection of anything
that happened after he went out for the
third round.
Fcr nearly, two months aftor the fight
FUzEimmons says he ha<i great difficulty
2n remembering ordinary Incidents of the
day. Try as he would, he could not fasten
in hts mind those things which he wish
ed to remember. Gradually he came to
himself, and as he recovered he became
more and more convinced that he had
met foul play.
Club will he opened to-morrow evening.
The court will be opened with a game be

ltllJvl l\toUllo>
"Longshot" Conley disturbed the usual
serenity of things at Oakland track yes
terday by getting home first on Colonel
Koot, a 30 to 1 shot in the betting, in tho
fifth race. The big chestnut horse was
formerly used as a cart horse on the
mountain ranch of Marcus Daly. He ar
rived here with Dan Dennison's string,
and was only recently purchased by Dr.
Kexford. Conley took him to the front,
and in a drive beat Meadow Lark less
than a length, with the favorite, Owyhee,
a close third.
In the other events decided favorites
fared better, winning four of the purses.
Old Dolore, which recently changed
owners, suffered a return of winning form,
beating out her field at the end without
effort, in the opening run at seven fur
longs. She was played from fours to 5 to
2 favoritism. Driving hard, Bullman land
ed Schiller In the place, ahead of Correct.
Clarando. with little W. Hennessy up, fell
on the back stretch.
The chestnutTenny colt Redwald'went to
the post an overwhelming choice for the
sprint over the Futurity course. Showing
Intermittent turns of speed and getting
c"ut off on two or three occasions, he
eventually won easily. Harry Thatcher,
the pacemaker, was ridden out to get the
place from Handera.
It was just like breaking eggs for May
W to beat Imp. Consilla In the six-fur
long sprint for mares. Don Cameron's
flyer had her price chopped from even
money to 3 to 5 and won all the way.
Monrovia, at long odds, finished a good
third behind Clonsilla.

rlblo, ridden by Jenkins, led almost from
the start In the mile and a furlong selling
affair. At the finish he was hard presÃed
by Itcd Pirate, which horse was backed
for a good thing. Del Paso, the favorite,
ran unplaced.
F. W. Brode at short odds ran away
from his field In the mile handicap for
three-year-olds. Anjou led Bathos past
the judges for the place.

BOLINAS, Jan. 29.â What may prove to
be a highly sensational strike was made
a few days 'ago in an old copper mine

SUCCESSOR CHOSEN
TO DR. SPALDING
Rev. Louis Sanford of Salinas
Considering a Call to
St. John's.
A successor to the Rev. Dr. Edward B.
Spalding of St. John's Episcopal Church,
on Fifteenth street, has been found in the
person of the Rev. Louis Childs Sanford
of Salinas, Monterey County.
As soon as it was ascertained by the
vestry of St. John's Church that Dr.
Spalding would probably never be in a
fit condition to resume his duties In the
parish, the vestry authorized a commit
tee, consisting of the principal lay olli
cers of the church â Judge F. \V. Van
Revm-gom, senior warden; F. H. Eich
baum; Junior warden; F. L. Southack.
treasurer, Â¦ and Dr. George S. Baker, sec
retary â to look about for a successor.
Last week the presence of so many clergy
at the Episcopal convention gave the
committee a splendid opportunity to make
a selection. This it did by picking out
the Rev. Louis Childs Sanford of Salinas
as the man that would best suit the
church and congregation.
An offer was made him to take charge
of St. John's parish. He asked to be per
mitted to take the offer under considera
tion for one week, at the same time giv
ing the committee to understand that he
looked favorably upon the offer. His an
swer Is expected to arrive within a few
days, when the committee will submit its
report to the vestry and in turn ask for
the confirmation by that body on its
choice of a new rector.
The Rev. Louis C. Sanford Is now in his
thirty-first year. He was born In Bris
tol, R. 1., and graduated from Harvard,
after which he took a course in the Epis
copal Theological School at Cambridge.
He was ordained by Bishop Clark In 1593
and shortly afterward came to Califor
nia, where he labored in the missionary
field in Fresno County. From there he
went to Salinas two years ago, where he
labored faithfully in building up the
church. His call to St. John's Is looked
upon as being an elevation, as it Is a large
and growing parish, with an increasing
congregation. Dr. Sanford Is said to be
an orator of no mean ability.

BOILERS EXPLODE
IN A STEEL MILL
One Man Killed and a
Dozen Injured.
PITTSBURG. Jan. 29.â The steel depart
ment of Phillips, Nlmlck & Co.'s mill on
West Carson street was completely
wrecked and a dozen men were injured
by the explosion of a battery of four large
boilers to-day. The shock of the bursting
boilers was heard throughout the lower
end of the city, and several thousand
persons were attracted to the scene of the
accident. The loss to the plant will be
enormous. Five of the Injured men were
mutilated almost beyond recognition and
one or two more deaths may result. A
rescuing party is searching the wreckage,
which, it Is supposed, contains other of
the workmen. The dead:
SIMON HOLLAND, fireman: died at
the Homeopathic Hospital.
The Injured: Daniel Noonan, badly cut
and scalded: Constantine Gallagher, badly
cut; Jeremiah Collins. W. T. Cook, Peter
Bynos.
The explosion was one of the most ter
rific that ever occurred in a Pittsburg
mill. The roof of the boiler-room was
completely lifted from the building and
the flying iron and steel fell In all direc
tions.
The men were crushed to the ground on
the spot where they were attending to
the rolls, and those beside the boilers were
scalded by the escaping steam.

Although the Nelll-O'Brien flght is a
long way off. It is believed by followers
of the fistic game that the contest will
not take place. They base this belief on
the fact that Neill is suffering from the
effects of a punch he is alleged to have
received below the belt in his last battle
with the PhlladelphJan. Neill is now un
der a physician's care, and as his in-
Jury may give him trouble when he under
takes hard training for the next bout, it
is thought he will refuse to go on with
O'Brien at the date named. He has al
ready asked for a postponement, and it
Is more than probable that he will ask for
another.
Should Neill decline to keep his en
gagement It is understood that "Paddy"
Purtell will take his place. Purtell Is un
der the management of "Bat" Masterson
who telegraphed to George Green, the lo
cal fighter, to match his man with the
winner of the Neill-O'Brien battle, or to
secure an engagement here with any good
man. Green ha 3 telegraphed to Purtell
to come out and he is expected to arrive
shortly.
Jack O'Brien is quietly preparing him
self for his next engagement. Each day he
goes to the gymnasium and punches the
bag for an hour at a time. He is grad
ually developing his hitting powers by
means of a bag built along the lines of
the one used by '"Kid" McCoy. His hands
are recovering from their soreness and
when he steps into the roped arena he
will be ready to put up a stiff argu
ment.
On the evening of the 7th of February
Jack McDonald and Phil ("Soldier")
Greene will box twenty rounds before the
Columbia Athletic Club. The men will
fight at 154 pounds for a purse and a side
bet of $250. McDonald won the middle
weight amateur championship of the
coast and the Oelrichs belt In the tourna
ment held at the Olympic Club some
months ago. He Is employed at the Union

WHIPPED IN A ROUND.
McPartland, Knocked Out by Mat
thews Early in the Game.
NEW YORK, Jan. 29.â A right-hand
lead landing fairly on the Jaw knocked
Kid McPartland down and out in the
first of what was to have been a twenty
round bout at catch weights to-night at
the Hercules Athletic Club in Brooklyn.
Matty Matthews was the Kid's adversary,
and Matty was the man who landed the
knockout blow. There was nothing to.it
up to the moment that Matty sent his
right to the mark. Both men were in
splendid condition and weighed about 140
pounds .each.
The men started in with a speed which
looked to be too fast to last. McPartland
bored in and rushed his man, using both
hands. His landing with the right on
Matthews' wind was a surprise to every
body as McPartland had always been
classed as a left-hand fighter. His new
tactics, however, failed to avail him to
any extent, as -he ran into. a straight
right-hand smash on the jaw which
knocked him down and out.

Connolly and Daly Draw.
BUFFALO, N. V., Jan. 29.â Before the
Olympic Athletic Club to-night Eddie
Connolly of St. John, N. 8., and Jack
Daly of Wilmington, Del., fought a twen
ty-round draw. The men boxed cautious
ly and coolly, neither showing the effects
of blows until the fifteenth round, when
Connolly, hitting In clinches, had Daly's
eyes in mourning and his face covered
with blood. Connolly was aggressive and
very strong, but Daly cleverly blocked his
rushes and landed many clean blows on
the face and ribs. Daly grew stronger
toward the . close and did more than his
share of the forcing. The honors were go
evenly balanced that the referee called
the contest a draw.

MCSICAL IXSTUCMEXTS.
"THE RIVALS"
WELL DONE IN
DOUBLE SENSE
Bill of New Acts at the
Orpheum.
Shade of the Immortal Sheridan! I
thought that Mr. James played horse with
"The School for Scandal," but he playa
automobile with "The Rivals." His emen
dations are manifold and multiform; &ross
indignities perpetuated on the text which
give to the whole an up-to-date atmos
phere that has about It the scent of as
phalt and the suggestion of tap-room wit.
Sheridan's memory might not suffer so
much if it were left in the care of the
company, and Mr. James allowed to sin
in single cussedness, but almost all tha
characters take a hand in the abuses and
the work of vandalism is complete. What
in the name of literature did Richard
Brinsley Sheridan ever do that he should
be handed such a package?
James as Bob Acres, gags, stammers,
interjects monosyllables with and' without
sense, all to the end, I take it, thut ho
may please the disciples of bad taste who
prefer a type of the immediate moment
to a more becoming type of of the yester
tlme, in which the play was writ.
The performance, however, in spite of
these attempts upon the idiom, is agree
able and In some respects it is the best
work that has' been done during the en
gagement. The mask of comedy worn
by Louis James is set in a grimace too
exaggerated to be pleasing. It does not
smile, but leers.
Some others in the cast are much more
pleasing. Mr. Langdon's Sir Anthony
Absolute is a pair with his Sir Peter Tea
zle. C? these two good parts of hia, the
former is the better. He has an intelli
gent grasp on the comedy of his role and
enlivens it with much spirit. Miss Kid
der'a Lydla is taking in its simplicty. It
is her first essay in comedy that strikes a
true note. There is no attempt at the
archness by which she usually rails, and
she is content to be natural without that
giddiness that so ill becomes her.
Mr. Hanford was a surprise. After his
vapid Joseph Surface, his William Jen
nings Bryan version of Macduff and his
idiotic lago, it was refreshing to see him
act the part of Captain Absolute with in
telligence and* a considerable comedy In
stinct. The Sir Lucius O Trigger of Barry
Johnstono was creditable, and the rest
of the company, with the exception of
the over-conscious Mr. Hackett, conduct
ed themselves admirably.
PORTER GARNETT.
Orpheum.
The Orpheura programme this week Is
replete with novelty and all the numbers
are of the highest class. James O. Bar
rows, Â«with Miss Florence Wllberham,
Brandon Mitchell and John Lancaster,
presented a clever drama, reminiscent of
the war. Edna Bassett Marshall and a
trio of clever youngsters made a hit. One
of the three children is a marvel of a
dancer, while the boys shine as acrobats.
The Sohlkes; novelty dances, introduced
five dusky Aguinaldos, clad only in
breechcloths and palm leaves. Papinta.
as usual, danced in the midst of the most
gorgeous color effects. Irene Franklin,
the singer, was recalled frequently, while
the orchestra, under Director Rosner,
was asked to repeat "I'd Leave My Hap
fiy Home for You" several times, the gal
ery contributing the chorus. Bruet and
Reviere, French mimics, were especially
successful in a cat duet. A trio of ath
letes performed on an invisible wire and
two of them closed the programme with
Borne feats on a ladder..
Grand Opera-House.
The tuneful comic opera "Boccaccio,"
by Franz yon Suppe, was the attraction
at the Grand Opera-house last night. It
proved as delightful and successful as on
its former presentation. William Wolff,
Winfred Goff and Arthur Wooley kept the
1 large audience convulsed with laughter
, and the solos by Edith Mason, Olive Vail.
Kate O'Niel. Georgie Cooper and Bessie
Fairburn had to be repeated. The
choruses were well rendered and the
cooper's song and chorus had to be re
peated several times.
California.
The Tabasco comedy, as the Califor
nia management has "In Paradise"
billed, seems to be to the taste of that
theater's patrons. The second week
opened last evening to a crowded house
and the Indications are that the play,
which runs until the end of the week, will
continue to please.
Alhambra.
A good audience and a tickled one at
tended the production of "His Better
Half" last night in the Alhambra. The
farce is simply a vehicle to carry the va
rious specialties of the company, some of
which are good, notably Charles Boyle's
burlesque of Sousa and the illustrated
story songs by Burt Gagnon. The per
formance would be improved by cutting
the farce as much as possible and adding
to the specialties.
The third week of "The Idol's Eye," at
the Tlvoll Opera-house, opened last night.
The jokes and situations were received
with applause and many of the musical
numbers were demanded over and over
again. The opera will continue in the bill
for some time.
Alcazar.
The Alcazar revived Sol Smith Russell's
pastoral play, "Peaceful Valley," last
night. It proved to be as great a success
as it was on its first presentation at the
Alcazar, and the principal actors received
a number of well earned recalls. "Peace
ful Valley" will run all this week and will
be succeeded by "Friends," in which Miss
Mary Hampton will make her appearance.

11fused to discuss the matter or to affirm
or deny the Interview. During the course
of the" meeting of the board he told his
colleagues that he wanted to finish up
some routine business before he left
town. Afterward he said he had refer-
I ence to a trip to Los Angeles he would
I take Wednesday night.
The presumption is that Commissioner
! Thomas was correctly quoted, and that
not only does ne intend to resign, but
( will do so before Wednesday night; and,
: judging from the actions of his fellow
Â¦ Commissioners at the meeting, it seemed
â¢to be understood that no action will be
i taken to select a Chief of Police until
the Mayor shall act on Thomas" resigna-
I tion.
The petition in favor of Esola, headed
!in big black, "In Behalf of an Honest
I Man," was presented by Captain Harry
I Goodall. He said it was bona lide, as far
j as he knew, and contained 7650 names.
He referred to the late lamented "vindi
cation" of Esola and asked that the Com
! sioners consider that : absent-minded
j your.g man when they come to make their
i appointment. The petition was received
! and placed on file.
The Commissioners took similar action
; with a communication from M. D. Jack
! son of the Golden Gate Park police, who
asked that he be considered a candidate
! for Chief of Police; and of letters from
! Charles Lyman, U. S. A., and Philip J.
i Lawler, cashier of Bulkley, Henshaw &
j Co., recommending Captain John Spillane
i for the position. Numerous applications
; for places and promotions in the depart
j merit were read and filed.
The consideration of license matters
; took up the remainder of the session, the
I board rejecting a score of applications
j for restaurant licenses to saloon-keepers
; having private rooms fitted contrary to
! the ordinance. The secretary was in
j structed to notify such applicants to ap
: : pear to-night before the board. Applica
i tions for saloon licenses from several
| Chinese were rejected.
When the board adjourned to meet
! again to-night Commissioner Biggy went
j to Chinatown to consult the Chinese Con
: sul, and the other Commissioners went to
the Mayor's office, where they were clos
. eted for a short time before going on an
i unofficial visit to the Chinese quarter.

DOES NOTHING
BUT ROUTINE
Fails to Name a New
Chief.
TWO HOURS IN OPEN SESSION.
COIOIISSIONEB. THOMAS WZLL
PKOBABLY RESIGN.
The Police Commissioners pat for two
hours last night in open session, but noth
ing they did would lead the public to be
lieve they had arrived any nearer to a
choice for Chief of Police than they were
a week ago. Once the backers of Esola,
alias Harrington, resorting to time-worn
devices, sought to force the issue by pre
senting a petition. The futility of this
move was so apparent that the members
of the board joined in an audible grin as
they waste-basketed the signatures and
sidetracked the designs of the pubiic en
emy. No other attempt was made during
the evening to force the question, which
seemed, by general consent of the board,
to be tabooed.
The demand of Jules J. Callundan, re
p'.gned. for $00 for services he never per
formed as patrolman, was rejected by the
beard.
The unanimity of the Commissioners on
a burning question was taken to Indicate
the truth of the rumor that Commissioner
Thomas Intends to resign, if he has not
already done so. He was quoted yester
day afternoon as having signified such in
tention.
"Is it not a fact. Mr. Thomas," he was
CLFkcd while at luncheon in the Palace
prill room, "that you have tendered to
Mayor Phelan your resignation as a mem
ber of the Police Commission?"
"I have told Â¦ Mayor Phelan," he Is re
ported to have- replied, "of my Intention
to resign, and he asked me not to discuss
the matter. Really, I do not care to taJk
about it." â¢
"But, Mr. Thomas." his questioner per
sisted, "you have fully made up your mind
to leave the commission, have you not? "
"Yes." was the reply. "I have. I want
to get away from It all. I Intend to re
sign. There is no use trying to serve the
city."

HONORED THE
PRESIDENT AT
BANQUET BOARD
Patriotic Bohemians
of America.
M'KINLEY'S NAME CHEERED.
CONGRESSMAN KAHN WHITES
OF THE STATE'S NEEDS.
Major General Shafter Accorded an
Ovation â Interesting Speeches
Delivered by Distinguished
Men â Those Present.
The Bohemians of America, a local pa
triotic organization composed of men of
every shade of political opinion, held Its
annual banquet last night In a downtown
rotisserie. The date was chosen In honor
of the anniversary of the birth of Presi
dent William J. McKinley. Seated around
a banquet board, gayly decorated with
flowers, flags and a life-sized picture of
the nation's chief executive, were the
members of the order and their invited
guests, among whom were Major General
William R. Shafter, Professor David Starr
Jordan, Hon. James A. Waymlre, Cap
tain W. H. Whiting, Hon. J. G. Maguire
and Mayor R. W. Snow of Oakland.
Throughout the evening an orchestra ren
dered patriotic and popular music, to
which the banqueters added their voices.
.At the conclusion of the repast F. D.
Brandon entered the field of poets to in
troduce the toastmaster, Henry I. Kowal
sky. The colonel was In his element in
that office, and his introductions of those
who addressed the gathering were filled
with glowing sentiments and lofty
periods. The mention of the President
was the signal for an enthusiastic out
burst, and his health was drunk in bump
ers or champagne. Every guest stood on
his feet and cbeered McKinley with all
possible fervor.
James A. Waymire was the first speaker
of the evening. He responded to the toast
"The President of the United States." Ha
traced the history of the Chief Executive
and extolled him for his statesmanship and
other virtues. When General Shafter
arose to respond to the toast, "The Army,"
he was accorded an ovation. The "hero
of Santiago" delivered an excellent speech,
in which he upheld his profession, told
of Its organization, Its career and Its nu
merous victories. His statement that the
nation had never suffered a defeat at the
hands of a foreign foe aroused great en
thusiasm. Dr. Jordan spoke on 'Our Uni
versities," a/id, as usual, the president of
Stanford University delivered an able ad
dress. He said he was willing to pit our
Institutions of learning against the whole
world. He gloried in the fact that it was
no longer Berkeley against Stanford or
Stanford against Berkeley, but two uni
versities against the world. His senti
ments were loudly applauded. The other
toasts responded to were: "The Navy,"
Captain W. H. Whiting; "Our Guests,"
Hon. T. J. Crowley; "California and Our
Sister States," Hon. J. G. Magulre; "Bo
hemians," Hon. John Hunt; "Our Munl
cipialities," Mayor R. W. Snow; "Our Or
der," Emmet Phillips, grand chief host;
"Our Country Members,'* Dr. H. B. Mehr
mann.
President McKinley, George H. Clarke,
General H. G. Otis and Hon. Julius Kahn
sent their regrets by letter and telegram.
Mr. Kahn. In his communication, stated
that he had received an invitation to re
spond to the toast, "California's Interests
in Congress, and How They Are Cared
For." Congressman Kahn regretted his
inability to be present, and therefore
transmitted a few of his thoughts In writ
ting. In part he said:
Among California*. Important Interests In the
present Congress are the laying of a Trans
pacific cable, the upbuilding of her merchant
marine, the early construction of the Nicaragua
canal, the holding of our possessions In the
Pacific Ocean, the maintenance of protection
to our ctrus fruit, beet sugar, wine, wool,
olive oil and other industries, and a large num
ber of measures of a purely local character.
One of the latter, a bill to enable the Navy De
partment to take the necessary steps prelim
inary to the construction of the new drydock
at Mare Island of concrete and stone Instead
of lumber, has already passed both houses of
Congress and Is now In the hands of the ex
ecutive for his approval. I am happy to state
that our entire delegation stands a solid pha
lanx for everything that'wlll help California.
The Interest of one part of our common
wealth is deemed the Interest of the entire
State VÂ»y every member. There Is absolute
and complete harmony among us whenever and
wherever California's welfare Is concerned, and
the fact that the entire delegation Is practi
cally a unit on such matters lia3 already proven
a tower of strength In several Instances.
I deem It proper at this time to make a
statement, the truth of which has Impressed
me very forcibly ever since my visit to Wash
ington just about a year ago. I realized then,
and I realize now. the fact that our State un
fortunately does not wield the Influence which
her wealth, her geographical location, her po
sition in the Union, entitle hÂ»Â»r to.
And I say unhesitatingly, after my observa
tions here, that this is largely due to the fact
that we are constantly making changes In our
delegation Ido not want to think lam thus
early making a bid to be returnedâ although
as I am among friends I may say that I shall
not be averse to re-electionâ but what I say In
this connection Is equally true of all States

HENRY WOHLER
MEETS DEATH
ON THE FRONT
Was an Old South Sea
Navigator.
SEALING VESSELS IN TROUBLE
THREE MEN DESERT SCHOONER
IN DRAKES BAY.
One of the best known captains in the
Southern Seas lost his life on the front
yesterday. Captain Henry Wohler of the
missionary schooner La Crolx dv . Sud
(Southern Cross) was asphyxiated In the
lodging-house at 4S East street, and al
though he was taken to the Harbor Hos
pital as soon as possible he had not even
a fighting chance for his life. Drs. Dorr
and Davis made a most careful examina
tion of the body, but there was not a
trace of life.
Captain Wohler . arrived here from Ta
hiti on the French mall boat City of Pa
peete on the 23d inst. He was accom
panied by Paul Welle and three native
Tahltlans, who were to man the La Croix
dv Sud. The vessel had been contracted
for by the missionaries who work among
the Marquesas, Caroline and Tahiti group
and when the news reached Papeete that
Matthew Turner, the builder, was ready
to deliver her to an accredited agent Cap
tain Wohler was sent here to bring her
down to the islands. On his arrival here
Captain Wohler went to live at 4S East
street, in order to be near his schooner.
On Sunday he was around the front
with Paul Welle and he then stated to
some of his friends that he was going to
start for Tahiti next Thursday. Laxly in
the evening he went to bed, and upon
retiring he must have turned out the gas
and then turned it on again. The only
illumlnant in Tahiti Is coal oil." and as
Captain Wohler has not been away
from the Southern Seas for many years
he probably had forgotten all he ever
knew about the deadly carbon monoxide.
He leaves four ohlldren In Tahiti ; to
mourn his loss. Captain Wohler was the
pilot of the United States Fish Commis
sion's schooner Albatross during her
cruise among the islands of the Southern
Seas.
The sealing fleet is doing fairly well.
Nearly all the schooners now on the coast
have made good catches, but several have
hard luck stories to tell. The Carlotta G.
Cox Is reported from Monterey bay with
132 skins. The Annie E. Paint with 62
skins and the Geneva with 131 skins, are
also reported from the same place. The
Annie E. Paint reports the loss of three
men In Drakes Bay. While the men were
at dinner three of the hunters got Into
one of the boats and made their escape
ashore. After that the schooner put to
pea and being caught In a squall lost her
gaff. She secured three new hunters in
Monterey Bay and had her damages re
paired.
On the Geneva the flag is flying at half
mast. Harry Sherman, one of the boat
pullers, fell overboard and was drowned.
The Geneva was 60 miles off Monterey
and making good headway. It was -a
beautiful night and the crew were en-
joying themselves on deck. While sky
larking Sherman lost his balance and fell
overboard. A boat was lowered and Ufa
buoys were thrown over, but no trace of
the missing man could be found. The
supposition is that he struck his head
against the side of the schooner and sank
at once.
The British ship Holywood, on which 10
per cent reinsurance was paid, has ar
rived at Honolulu.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
steamer Curacao arrived from Mexican
ports yesterday. She brought up nine
cabin and nine steerage passengers and
IGSO.OOO In treasure. Of the latter amount
$170,000 Is from the Candelaria mine. Cap
tain yon Helms reports that the schooner
Ijottlo-M had been seized by the Mexican
authorities at Ensenada for an attempt
to evade the customs regulations. The
little vessel had stopped at a number of
ports after leaving San Diego and was
therefore In difficulties as soon as Mexico
was reached. Captain Hall of the Lottie
M has laid his case before Rear Admiral
Kautz, who Is now at Magdalena Bay on
the cruiser Philadelphia, and ho Is doing
everything possible for htm.
The big ship Shenadoah has been char
tered by Eddy, Chapman, Falk & Co. to
load for Sydney, N. S. W. She will carry
1.500,000 fe"et of lumber and about 3000 tons
of general merchandise, which will make
the largest cargo that has ever left here
in one bottom for Australia.
and Narjot had been living there for
some months as man and wife under the
name of Mr. and Mrs. Ortes. She came
to this city from Lacrosse, Wis., about
two years ago. and a few months later
met Narjot. She in part corroborates
Narjot's story. She said she went Into a
private box with a man whom she met on
the street and they had a drink. She had
a $5 gold piece in the pocket of her jacket,
and she missed It. She accused the man
of taking It and he attempted to strike
her. She ran screaming from the room,
followed by the man, into the piano room,
and cried out that she had been robbed.
Narjot stepped in between her and her
pursuer, and she saw Gleeson grab Narjot
and hold him while the stranger struck
him on the head and face. Narjot broke
away and two or three went after him,
and she saw him pull the gun and shoot
Gleeson. She did not know the name of
the man who she says robbed her.
Narjot Is known as a crack pistol shot.
He has employed Attorney Eddie Sweeney
to defend him and he will plead self-de
fense.
Mrs. John Dray, a saleswoman at New
man & Levison's, Is Narjot's wife. They
were married in September, 1898, "and six
weeks later, she says, her husband took
her savings of $GOO and deserted her. She
sought a divorce, but could not find
Narjot to serve papers on him. His wife
says he has been in several shootings, and
was divorced prior to her marriage. Dray
was her name when she married Narjot.
She was then a widow.
THE man who fatally shot James
O'Neill Gleeson, the .bartender at
Stanley's Grotto, Mason and Turk
streets, Sunday night was Ernest
Narjot, son of the late S. O. Nar-
Jot, the well-kno^wn artist. He tele
phoned yesterday 'from Oakland to De
tectives Ed Gibson and George McMahon
that if they wanted him he would come
over and deliver himself up, and they ad
vised him to do so. He came across the
bay on the 2 o'clock boat, and the two de
tectives were at the ferry to meet him.
Narjot was taken to the City Prison,
where he was booked on a charge of mur
der. He had the revolver, a 32-caliber
Colt's, quite new, in his pocket, and it
was booked as evidence.
Before being locked up he was taken
to the Receiving Hospital at his request,
as he had several bumps and bruises on
his face and head, which he claimed to
have received Just before he fired the
fatal shot. He said that V. D. Meade, the
man who was with Minnie Hamilton, the
colored waiter and Gleeson all set upon
him and beat him, and when he tried to
escape up the stairs they barred the way
and he pulled his revolver and fired, us
he was afraid of his life. He Is 36 years
of age and a machinist by occupation.
Minnie Hamilton was found at 810 Mis
sion street yesterday morning by De
tective McMahon and Policeman Joy. She

About ten minutes after 1 o'clock yes
terdey afternoon Poetz walked Into the
office of the Albion Lumber Company, at
Fifth and Hooper streets, and calmly pro
ceeded to arrange his necktie, which was
In a disordered condition. He was given
a mirror by J. H. Wilhelm, one of the
cl.rkp. and as soon as his tie was ad
jufted told Wilhelm and another clerk
named W. H. Depew that he had been
â¢â¢soaked." Both asked what he meant
and received the answer, delivered In an
cxciied manner, that he had been robbed
out of JSOO by two thugs, one of whom
! had choked him, while the other cut the
strap by which ha carried the satchel in
which the money was contained, eus
y.ended from his shoulder. He stated that
a !-ack of coin containing Jl^JO. which he
carried in a rear pocket of his trousers,
and one containing ilow, carried In a front
pocket, remained in his possession, as the
robbers evidently did not know he had so
xauch money on his peruon.
Without waiting for instructions in the
matter Wilhelm immediately telephoned
acting Chief Biggy, who dispatched De
tectives T. L. Ryan and Edward ODea to
:the *cene and then no tilled Arthur L.
Whitney, a member of the firm. A short
time afterward telephonic reports of such
Â¦a nature were received that Detectives
Cody and Tom Gibson were set to work
on the casa. , -,
Ryan a:;<i ODea found Poetz at the of
fice" <jf the Albion Lumber Company and
â¢went over the ground with him. He took
'thorn to what is called a "gangway," a
narrow road between tall piles of lumber,
and explained in detail how the robbery
occurred. He said he had driven into the
lumber-yard from Sixth street and when
he reached the "gangway" turned into it.
He was half way through when he per
ceived a boxcar on the track ahead of
him. and seeing that it would be useless
to go farther he started to pull In his
horse. Suddenly he was seized from be
hind and choked by "a short man" and at
the fame time "a tall man" cut the cord
by which the satchel was clung from his
shoulder. He found himself on the ground
in a dazed condition, with a dim idea that
he ought to reach the office of the com
pany, and he started for there. He did
not see anybody until he was seized and
has no Idea In which direction his assail
ants went. This was his btory.
1 By orders of liiggy Detectives Ryan and
i O f Dea brought their man to headquarters,
where the acting Chief put him through a
rigorous cross-examination. He was
asked how It was that he had not yelled
to attract attention and did not try to
follow the men: why he was so cool about
arranging his tie before he had related his
story to the clerks and why he did not in
stantly telephone the police or his em
ployers. To these queries he replied that
it was doubtless owing to his dazed con
dition, caused by the choking he received.
In the meantime Detectives Ryan and
Cody had been sent back to the scene of
the supposed robbery. When Biggy had
done questioning the boy he sent him
back to the lumber yard in care of Detec
tive Tom Gibson. Near the scene
were found the other officers and Arthur
L. Whitney, who had driven there. Young
Poetz was again asked to recount what
had occurred and explain away doubtful
points. He was recalled to the office in
care of Gibson by a telephone that two
suspects had been brought in and the al
leged victim was wanted to see If he
could identify them, but he said he could
What mystified the police was that
James Kenney and Harry Wigner, two
employes, were working near the en
trance to the "gangway," and yet did not
soe Poetz drive in there or anybody fol
low or leave after the time he says he
entered. A number of workmen were also
employed In loading the car at the other
end of the "gangway. " They saw noth
ing and heard nothing. Every -workman
on the place showed his skepticism on the
subject of robbery by laughter when the
word was mentioned. In view of the cir
cumstances mentioned and the additional
facts that Pietz's collar was not badly
soiled, and that a scratch on the rear axl?
of the buggy was of such a nature that
it could hardly have been made by the
heel of a man's shoe while choking an oc
cupant of the vehicle, the police decided
that no robbery had oceurretl. The detec
tives went after Poetz in a searching
cross-examination, and after being closely
questioned on every detail of his story he
made admissions which strengthened the
detectives' theory that he had taken the
money himself. Finally he confessed hav
ing buried the money in the cellar of his
house at 32 Kissling street. Detectives
Gibson and Cody accompanied the young
man to his home and he led them to the
spot where it was buried.
Poetz was then brought back to the City
Prison, where he was charged with
larceny. The police and even the young
man's employers are Inclined to believe
that he is not mentally responsible for his
act.
Arthur L. Whitney says that Poetz has
been In the employ of the company for
six years, Â¦working up to his present po
sition from that of office boy. He is 18
years old. He had always been a trusted
employe.

SADNESS FOR
CHINESE WITH
THE HEW YEAR
The Police Restric
tions Enforced.
CELEBRATION COMMENCED.
LARGE CROWDS THRONG THE
STREETS OF CHINATOWN.
The present occasion of Chinese New
Year is to the heathen one of sorrow
instead of joy. With the vigilance of a
police force composed of over one hundred
men, each guardian of the peace watch
ing an opportunity to cast the wily Mon
golian behind prison bars should he trans
gress in the slightest degree upon the
rules laid down by Acting Chier Biggy.
the outlook for a round of gladsome fes
tivities is sadly darkened.
The New Year proper commenced early
this morning. One hundred patrolmen in
uniform dotted the streets and there was
little excitement. All business was sus
pended and the only celebration which
was permitted the Chinese was a visit
to the joss houses, where they went in
large numbers. The construction of
stands on which services have hitherto
been conducted and about which crowds
congregate was not allowed and the
crackle of fire-crackers was conspicuously
absent in the Chinese section. The cele
bration this year will be more of a spec
tacular nature than it ever has been be
fore, and what the Chinese lack in noise
and bustle they have accomplished in
decoration. The principal thoroughfares
are aglow with lanterns of all descriptions
and tne interior of many abodes present
fine appearances.
Last night sales of holiday goods were
made from the sidewalks In front of the
principal stores. This business was sus
pended when the clock struck 12, and the
Chinamen took their wares in from the
street and closed their stores. Most places
will remain closed for a period of three
days, but the more wealthy class of mer
chants will continue to celebrate for one
week. Large crowds of people visited
Chinatown, and for several hours the side
walks were packed with humanity.
The police restrictions have cast a glocm
over Chinatown. Many observances which
constitute a happy new year with them
have been forbidden, and there is little re
joicing. The explosion of fireworks is re
earded by them as an omen of good luck,
and when excluded from a celebration,
such as the present, they believe that UJ
fortune will follow them until the next
occasion of a celebration. Acting Chi^f
Bijruy is determined, however, that no
rTrivileges shall be granted until his de
mands are complied with and until he has
in his possession a list of the tons leaders
and also their promise that they will 111
future conduct themselves in accordance
W To-day wm be spent by the Chinese in
visiting each other at their respective
houses. â.
Reached Port.
Shortly after midnight the San Bias,
from Panama, and thÂ» Volumcia, from
Hamburg, were reported by thÂ» Mer
chants' Exchange lookout as passinic
through the heads.

TWO SCHOOLS ABOLISHED.
Board of Education Complies With
Charter Requirement.
The Board of Education met yesterday
morning and passed resolutions abolishing
the Rlncon Evening School and the Cliff
House School. It was represented that
the Rlncon School had an average daily
attendance of sixty pupils, with three
teachers, and cost $2500 each year. The
pupils will bo sent to the Lincoln Evening
School and the teachers were placed on
the unasslgned list. The Cliff School
costs annually JISOo. with an average daily
attendance of fourteen, and the pupils can
easily attend other schools In the Rich
mond district.
The schools were abolished In accord
ance with a provision of the charter
which limits tne amount of money to be
used for the payment of employes of the
School Department to $2S per pupil In
average dally attendance.
A. Lafallle was allowed $17 50 a month
in addition to his salary of $75 as team
ster, he being required to furnish his own
buggy.
