Every Republican member
voted for Bard.
Of the Democrats, Ashe,
Chapman and Feeney re
fused to vote for Phelan, and
did not answer when their
names were called.
vantage except those which resulted from his
natural capacity and energy, Mr. Bard has ac
cumulated large wealth, by the development of
natural resources, through his executive abil
ity, untiring industry and sound business Judg
ment.
He has developed. In Ventura, and Is now
interested In Los Angeles, In a large oil pro
duction, controlled by the Union Oil Company
he Is the president and director of banking In
stitutions in Ventura and Los Angeles, and
conducts a large, warehouse and shipping busi
ness, as well as immense farming and agri
cultural Interests.
. He was baptized in the Republican party in
those years of the war of the rebellion in a
place and at a time when every man pro
fessing Republicanism required tlie courage, of
his convections. Since his residence In this
State he has been prominently identified with
that party in his own locality, and' has -re
ceived recognition from the party of the State,
being twice chosen Vs a delegate to the Na
tional Convention, and as ' an elector in the'
campaign of 1592 he had the distinguished
honor cf being the only Republican elector on
his ticket to enter the electoral college of
this State. -
He has ever been forward In contributing
his means and counsel to the success of his
party In every campaign.
While these characteristics have made up his
public career, his private character Is the sub
ject which those who know, him best must
ever most .sincerely admire.
His character for probity and honorable dig
nity compel the heartiest admiration of all
who know him best. The loyalty of his friend
ship, and the true nobility, of his alms, dis
tinguish him among his fellow men. Pos
sessed of stronsr convictions and sound Judg
ment, he has always displayed a. fearless and
intelligent Judgment on all public questions.
In every struggle with oppression or injus
tice he will be found on the side of the right.
Fearless In the performance of duty, he Is
a true friend of the people. Of a retiring dis
position, and averse to display, his charities
Â¦and benevolence are never ostentatiously dis
closed, but his friends and admirers are well
nigh co-extensive with the acquaintances with
whom he has come In contact.
He is every Inch a Senator. And when he
represents this golden empire In that exalted
body. which has been called "An Assembly
of Kings," at -the capital of our nation every
true Callfornlan will have reason to be proud
of the selection this day made by the Republi
can party of this State. .He will exemplify the
words of that wisest- of men: "Seest thou
a man diligent In his business? he shall stand
before kings; he shall not stand before mean
men." \ . 'Â¦

SECONDING SPEECH BY
ASSEMBLYMAN COBB
Assemblyman VT. H. Cobb of San Fran
cisco was at once recognized by the chair
and followed Valentine In an eloquent sec
onding speech. He spoke as the repre
sentative of those who had so long stood
by Colonel Burns, and his peroration wort
him round after round of applause. Mr.
Cobb had to say:
Many grave measures are pressing forward
for Congressional consideration at this time.
The reciprocity treaties with foreign countries,
the Storage of fiood waters, tha irrigation and
reclamation of desert lands, the Pacific cable,
the Nicaragua canal and the Philippine Islands
all require earnest attention at once. Never
before have so many great questions of vital
Interest to the Pacific Coast arisen at the same
time, and California is more espec^Uly Inter
ested fti all these issues than any other State.
Our commercial and Industrial interests are
rapidly forcing us into broader fields of activity
and we cannot afford to sit supinely by and
see the rich treasures of trade and commerce
slip from our grasp If proper legislation can
secure them to us forever. Our enemies arÂ»
aSake to the opportunity and will checkmate
us If they can. Public as well as party In
terest now demand that our personal prefer
ences give way to the voice of the majority
that a Senator may be elected without delay.
We have Â¦ therefore assembled to complete tha
work we let t undone at our regular session
and to elect a United State* Senator. The
iinportar.ee of his dalle* requires that he bo
a man of distinguished ability. He need not
necessarily be an orator, but he must be a
thinker, able to think with the shrewdest men
of the nation. Incompetency would be as
dangerous as the basest treachery. Better a
vacant chair than to fill it with either a
blunderer or a traitor. He must be upright
and honorable, of known fidelity to the State
and nation, and must possess the win power
and energy of Hercules to accomplish the
work exoected of him at this time. The time
has come lor us to unite and place the toga
upon the shoulders of an. honest, abie. ener
getic and courageous man! who will make an
aggressive fight on behalf of the interests
peculiar to this coast and assist us to win a>
victory in our struggle for commercial and in
dustrial supremacy.
The gentleman whose name has Just been
placed before you possesses every requisite of
this important office to a marked degree. - It*
needs no one to vouch for him. His character
Is plainly written in. his face. Culture and re
finement fit him like a garment. While ne has
all the advantages which education and stud?
can give, his steady eye shows a wisdom
broader and deeper than the learning taught
In schools and marks him as a man eminently
fitted and qualified to fill this resQonsible po
sition with credit to himself end honor to thÂ»
State and nation. And his selection at thla
time is peculiarly appropriate. In the bitter
party strife Just ended no wound Is attributable
to his hand. Time with its soothing touch Is
not needed to smooth down feelings ruffled by
his success. The State and party will welcome
his election with unanimous approval. All Â¦of
us can unite In his support without disloyalty
to our particular candidate. I still assert my
confidence in the character, ability. Integrity
and fitness of Colonel Burns for the office you
have denied him. but on behalf of his friends I
am authorised to say ttat we accept Mr. Bard
as the most satisfactory substitute you could
have chosen for us. While he la your candi
date he will be our Senator.
California Is in its infancy. Its resources ars>
undeveloped and unknown. Its marvelous in
crease In public and private wealth in tha
past sinks into insignificance before the start
ling possibilities of the future. Nature has
scattered her treasures with a lavish hars.t
along the shores of the mighty Pacific, and w<Â»
have faith to believe that our hardy pioneers
planted here the seeds of & mlgthy empire,
which in the fullness of, time will develop a
grander ctvllliatlon than any the world has
e\er known. The man with the hoe. the man
with the pen and the man with the sword have
already started the wheels of progress turning,
and whether the future shall bring new bless
ings to our State or shall scatter the treasures
gathered with so much toll and suffering de
pends upon the men who snap* oar future in
dustrial, educational and political policies.
i Mr Speaker, and members of the Assembly,
with a full appreciation of th# duties and re
sponsibilities of the office and with full con
fidence In the character and ability of the man.
I take pleasure in seconding the. nomination
as a candidate for United States Senator th*
Hon. Thomas K. Bard.
Assemblyman Works of San Diego
claimed the floor next and spoke well and
emphatically for the ex-Grant faction.
"TVe failed to elect a Senator at the last ses
sion " said he "and since that time the upper
most question has been how to retrieve that
error The people have wanted a Senator. thÂ«
administration has demanded one. and now wÂ»
are come here to choose one. So lon* as hÂ«
was in the flsht I. like many others, stayed
with one candidate, but knowing now that hÂ»
cannot be elected, we bow to thÂ» will of thÂ»
majority and speaking for my candidate I now
say it Is my pleasure to second the nomination
of the Hon. Thomas It. Bard."
SPEECH BY BELSHAW
WINS HIM APPLAUSE
Belshaw of Martn followed Mr. Lardner
In - another seconding speech, which
brought htm much applause. He spoke as (
follows:
Mr. Speaker: It to with grÂ»at pleasure . that
I rise to second the nomination of Thomas U.
The people of the State of California are to
be congratulated on the happy termination oi
the Senatorial question. After a spirited con
test which continued through the last session
of this Legislature we have been convened,
in extra session and are about to fulfill our
duty to the people of this State as well *a
to the people or the United States. When tha
ballot shall be taken to-day the result wiU
show that we have accomplished the primary
object for which we were called together.
In the selection of Mr. Bard we shall choosw
a man whose honesty, integrity and ability
assure us a most competent representation la
the national Congress. While Mr. Bard is a
resident of the southern portion of our State
nevertheless he will be as much the Senator
for the north as for the south, and I feel
assured that he will not be influenced by any
sectional feeling, but will take It upon him
self to look after the interests of California:
therefore I esteem it an honored privilege to
second the nomination of Thomas R. Card.

The members of the Solano

San Francisco delegation to visit
the Presidio reservation and in

assembled to honor the new Sen

The transformation scene is
especially delightful to those who
have seen a motley crowd of pol
iticians loitering and spying
around for Senatorial develop

Colonel George H. Pippy and
Joseph S. Spear, Surveyor of the
Port of San Francisco, arrived
to-night and in behalf of the

The Senator accepted for Sat
urday night next. To-mor

extend an invitation in joint con
vention for both houses of the
Legislature to attend the recep

An undertone of comment is
caused to-night by the absence
of Governor Gage from Senator
Bard's reception. State officers,
members of the Legislature and
leading citizens generally attend
ed. Adjutant General Seamans
was among" the attendants, but
he did not express to the Senator
regrets for the Governor's in
ability to be present.
The Union League committee

that there was not enough patriotism in the

despite the detraction of Its motives, despite
the misrepresentations of Its acts, despite the
fact that the organs of the opposition* had
levied notlre on the State that this extra ses
sion would be a saturnalia of fraud and cor

forces have concentrated on a man whose can

We called this extra session called together
with general public . misgivings. â¢ We read the
history of former extra, sessions and found no

at Washington the constitutional representation

performance of that trust was superior to any
candidate and to all candidates. â¢ For the first
time In the hlfctory of the' State we have seen
the office seek the manâ an unparalleled lesson
In clean politics that' has brought us all closer
together and closer to the people of California.
We have seen the candidates themselves catch
something ol the spirit of the- Legislature.
We have seen Irving M. Scott tell his l friends
not to consider his personality, or candidacy aÂ»
against the supreme Interests of the Republican
party we have seen U. S. .Grant instruct his
close friends not to let hlÂ» name stand in the
way of united and rapid action; we have wen

â¢In tho spirit of absolute Â¦ independence that
has characterized the action of this Legislature
thus far, in the renewed â¢ sense of .patriotism

Just before noon Johnson of Sacra

and Dibble took advantage of the oppor

to open the proceedings. It read as fol

during the late fight â¢ was represented.
Valentine, for the southern delegation,
placed Thomas R. Bard In nomination.
W-i E. Cobb and Grove Johnson seconded

VALENTINE ELOQUENTLY
NOMINATES BARD
Valentine, in placing the Venturan in
nomination, said:
Mr. Speaker arid gentlemen of the Assembly:
During the whole of the last session of the
Legislature several distinguished gentlemen.
citizens of the State of California, were sup
ported loyally throughout the whole session by
their supporters In Joint convention, voting for
them as candidates for the United States Sen
ate. That they were entitled to the confidence
not only of their supporters, but of the people
of the State of California is manifest,
and it -Is fortunate for this great nation of
ours, magnificent as she is with all her 're
sources, to have so many who can so well
and ably represent her in the higher branch
of the legislative halls in Washington. The
Governor of the State, seeing the necessity
of full representation in. the Congressional
halls, has placed as foremost in his proclama
tion calling us together In this extraordinary
session the election of a United States Senator,
and I think none of you will deny that that
Is the question paramount in the State of Cali
fornia to-day.
Situated on this western coast of the coun
try we will be first to receive the advantage
of the . Oriental trade, where we .will be the
first "to receive the advantage of the expansion
taking in. thus, as we hare the Islands of
the Orient ar.d over which Old Glory will
wave forever, taking in as we have the islands
midway In the Pacificâ the Hawaiian Islands
all of these benefits will first come to the
door of California. We will first receive the
advantage of these acquisitions, and it Is
proper and right that we should have full
representation In both branches of Congress
so that California may derive the full benefit
of these advantages.
When we come to. the question of who shall
be the Senator to represent us and act as
the colleague of the Hon. George C. Perkins
we have been deliberating over that question
for some time. We have a man. coming not
particularly from the south, not from the
north, not from the east or the west, but from
the whole State of California; one who Is
broad ' enough, who Is great enough In every
capacity to -fully, represent the great State of
pleasure in saying It. Special stress was
made of the fact that Mr. Bard's selec
tion was a case of the office seeking the
man. Attention was also called to the
action of leading Republican candidates
for the office who had cast aside their
personal ambitions In order that the fu
ture of their party in California wquld
not be Jeopardized.
In marked contrast to the enthusiasm
that greeted the name of Thomas R. Bard
was the gloom that spread over the Sen
ate like a pall when the minority pre
sented James D. Phelan as its candidate.
No applause followed his nomination: and
when the roll was called several of the
Democrats refused to vote.
SENATOR ROWELL PLACES
BARD IN NOMINATION
Mr. Bard was placed In nomination by
Senator Rowell, whose address, while
brief, awakened all of the pent-up enthu
siasm of the supporters of the gentleman
from the south, and at the close they
burst forth In round after round of cheer-
Ing. The Senator said:
Mr. President: A little more than one year
ago I had the pleasure of presenting to this
body for its Senatorial suffrage the name of
Thorns s R. Bard. To-day it gives me double
pleasure to again present the same name for
a like suffrage. Then it was the personal ex
pression of long friendship and exalted ad
miration for the man. now It is an expression
of the spontaneous sentiment of this body and
with the spontaneous and hearty approval of
the people of the State of California.
At least for once In ths history of our politics
a great and generally coveted position has
sought the man and not the man the position.
Mr. President, there is little that need be said
in behalf of the man whose name I rtTtr. If
mature years, a high order of Intelligence, a
life's honorable record, a comprehensive knowl
edge of men "and affairs and a thcrougn ap
preciation of and faith In those principles of
government which we believe have been con
ducive to the welfare of our country are â¢rual
lflrations then this body has found the man
for United States Senator. But, Mr. Presi
dent, there is more in this election of a Sena
tor than merely the selection of a well qual
ified public servant or the expression of ad
miration for or good will toward an honorable
citizen. The electwn of Thomas R. Bard will
mean an emphatic expression of a rÂ»pidly
growing sentiment throughout our land that
politics In this country, must and shall l>e con
ducted on higher planes. I bespeak for Mr.
Bard, if elected, an honorable standing among
the Senators of the nation, and 1 promise fcr
him that he. will represent California and all
her interests at the national capital with
credit to himself and to the honor and to the
benefit of the State.
NOMINATION SECONDED
BY SENATOR BOYCE
The honor of seconding the nomination
fell to Senator .Boyce of Ventura, who Is
a lifelong friend of the new Senator. Mr.
Boyce was extremely earnest In all he
said, and his remarks were listened to
with the most profound interest. His
speech follows:
Fellow- Senators: Representing, as I do. In
this body, '-he county of Ventura, I feel that
there Is imposed upon me a momentous duty
as well as a grateful pleasure.* In rendering
tribute to an esteemed friend. Having enjoyed
the personal friendship of the distinguished
gentleman who has been placed In nomination
for the exalted office of United States Sena
tor for more than a score of yenrs, I am
glad to have the opportunity to raise my voice
aÂ« a witness to his worth,Â» and In the name
of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, where
his name is a household word. I rise to second
the nomination of the Hon. Thomas R. Bard.
Mr Bard was born In Chambersburg. Frank
lin 'county Pennsylvania, in the month of De
cember IS4L He is descended from that sturdy
and virile race which has furnished to thlÂ«
country some of her noblest sons; a race which
mingles in its current the blood of. two of

to the British empireâ the Scotch-Irish; the
stock from which springs our noble Â¦President,

MENTO, Feb. 6.â The last trace of what
ever ' heartburnings ' may have resulted
from the Senatorial struggling was erased
to-night when the contending factions and
the citizens of Sacramento gave a recep
tion in honor of California's new Senator,
The parlor floor of the Golden Eagle was
"the scene of the festivities. : Potted plants,
palms and cut flowers were used in. pro
fusion to decorate the t"eceptlon hall, cor-
Iridors and the rooms occupied by Senator
Bard "as his headquarters.^, f v V
The reception began about 9 o'clock and
lasted until after midnlghj. Those who
had been the most bitter opponents of the
Venturan were the most hearty and sin
cere in their congratulations and expres
sions of fealty. The wives and daughters
of many of the legislators and some of
the. most prominent society ladles of the
capital city formed one of the most at
tractive features of the reception.
Senator \Bard, the guest of honor, was
the 'center around which all revolved. The
smiles with which his countenance beamed
told plainly that he appreciated the cor
diality of the reception and saw much for
'congratulation in the recementlng of Re
publican ties. Mrs. Thomas Flint, wife
of Senator Flint, and Mrs. Gray assisted
Senator; Bard in receiving the guests.
'; The health and success 'of the Senator
were wished from every Up, while empha

ANOTHER OF THE
BURNS MEN TALKS
Assemblyman Pierce of Yolo County
also spoke from the standpoint of an ex
supporter of Burns and_ voiced his good
will af follows:
Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Assembly:
For nearly one hundred days have we labored
with this proposition trying to nominate a can
didate for United States Senator who shall
succeed the Hon. Stephen M. White. For near
ly one. hundred days have we been divided' in
faction,; and to-day, as representatives, we are
united here and hope to see go out from this
assemblage the words to the people of this
State, that we have united upon a man in
whom we have the utmost confidence. I do not'
desire to refer to his ability, honesty and in
tegrity; I take it, gentlemen, that the mere
fact that his nomination upon this floor Is due
evidence to every one of . these virtues.
It has been my duty to follow In the foot
steps of one whom I have ever found true to
the Republican party and the State. My loy
alty to him la. as great as It has ever been,
but the majority of the Republicans in this
House have agreed to nominate another candi
date and that candidate to-day is my candi
date. - Wo are told by him to give our honor,
our best efforts to the election of Thomas R.
Bard and . we are here to-day to carry out
thÂ« words of him whom, we supported so honor
ably last -session."
f Gentlemen of California, we are anxious that
wo have our full share In the Senators of the
United Statea and we realize that to-day we
are to perform a great blessing upon the State
of California when we say to her that we have
selected a man for this position and, gentle
men, it gives me great pleasure at this time
to second the nomination of Thomas R. Bard.

Under the Terms of the Treaty,
United States Cannot Fortify
the Waterway.
WASHINGTON; Feb. 6.-Secretary Hay
Is determined that the State Department
f-he!l observe with the most scrupulous
fidelity whatever obligation may rest "upon
it toward Nicaragua and Costa Rica in
tho matter of the construction of the
N'icarag-uan canal. It has not been possi
ble to move In that matter pending the
removal â¢of the obstacle in the way of
canal building presented by the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty. There has not been the
slightest disposition to ignore the Gov
ernments of our sister republics in the
matter, but, in the view of the depart
ment, it would rot have" been dignified
or safe to make overtures to them before
the United States had acquired the power
to deal with a free hand with the canal
problem bo far as Great Britain was co:i
cerned. Now, however, the department
v.-ill address itself to the Governments cf
Nicaragua and Costa Rica looking to the
acquirement of whatever privileges are
deemed essential to the construction of
the canal and its operation.
About the same time, or. rather, as coon
as> the Senate shall have ratified the
treaty and the ratifications shall have
been exchanged, the department will ad
dress identical notes to the great mari
time powers of the whole world to secure
their adhesion to .the project for the per
petual neutrality of the canal.
The following is the text of the new
Treaty negotiated in relation to the con
etruction of the Nicaraguan canal:

jesty, the Queen of the United Kingdom of

WILLIAM McKINLEY.
" Executive Mansion, Washington, D. C . Feb.
5, 1900.
Cincinnati Jurist to Head the Body
That Will Establish Civil Gov
ernment on the Islands.
T T TASHINGTON. Feb. 6.â The
\A / President ! to-day appointed
1/1/ "Judge Â¦ William H. Taft of Cin
â¢ V V clnnati. United States Judge of
* * the Sixth Judicial Circuit, to
be president of the new Philippine Com
mission. Judge Taft's place on the bench
will be filled by the appointment of Judge
Henry F. Severans 6f Grand Rapids.
Mich These announcements were made
at the close of the Cabinet meeting to
day. â¢ â¢ - - .
Judge Taft has been in Washington sev
eral days, presumably coming at the re
quest of the President. This morning he
called at the White House a little before
10 o'clock in company with Judge WilUam
R Day. former' Secretary of State and
later president "of the Paris Peace* Com
mission.. They remained with the Presi
dent until the Cabinet meeting at 11
o'clock and joined him again after the
Cabinet had adjourned.
On leaving the White House he said the
commission of which he had been ap
pointed president would sail from San
Francisco soon after March 15. and its
special mission would be the establish
ment of a civil government for the
islands. Further than that he was not at
liberty to speak. It is understood that the
other members of the commission will be
designated within a very- short time and
that special instructions which will guide
them in the discharge of their duties will
be prepared at as early a day as possible.
The appointment of this commission Is
carrying out the suggestions of the pres
ent Philippine Commission, which will
shortly go*out of existence. Some of the
members of the old commission, it is said,
will be appointed on the new one. ...
The appointment of Judge Taft marks
the first selection for the new Philippine
Commission. There will be five member*
on the commission, and all of them will
be civilians. Schurman. president of the
existing commission, has declined for
business reasons to remain on the com
mission, so Judge Taft will be president
in his place. Mr. Denby and Professor
Worcester have been invited to accept
appointments, but so far have not signi
fied their intentions. Admiral Dewey will
not go back to Manila, and General Otis
will give way, like him, to a civilian.'
Secretary Root said to-day that no in
structions had been framed for the new
commission as yet. but it would be easy
to perceive from the sentiments set out
In the President's message on tne subject
what these instructions would be.
Judge Taft called at the War Depart
ment to-day in company with Judge L>ay.
lat# Secretary of State, and had a long
talk with Secretary Root as to the plans
of the commission.' As slime surprise has
been caused by the willingness of Judge
Taft to surrender a life position of the
dignity and emolument of a United Statea
Circuit Judge to Join the commission, it
may be said that the prevalent impression
is ' that as soon as the commission shall
have succeeded In replacing the existing
military government in the Philippines
with stable civil government Judge Taft
will be named as the first civil Governor
General of the archipelago. It is not
thought that this change will take plaeo
at once, but the commission 1s expected
to move steadily toward that object and
to set up local civil governments as fast
as the Filipinos shall demonstrate their
worthiness.

by a wave of prosperity. This will have
considerable bearing on the next |Presi
dential election and will very materially
improve the chances for the renomination
of Mr. McJvinley. When times are good
it is not as easy to stir up a hot political
campaign as when they are not. If things
are going along well the people rest con
tented with what they have and are not
so anxious for a change. This makes tho
task of retaining what it has much
easier to the party in power, whatever
party that may be.
"I don't think it will he possible for the
Republicans or any other party to pre
vent the renomlnatlon of Mr. Bryan. As
to the platform on which he will work, I
imagine it will be much the same as the
last one. The silver plank will be of the
same dimensions. If silver was good in
ISS6 I can see no reason why it will not be
just as good, in fact better, in 1900 I
don"t know who will head the ticket with
Mr. Bryan. I will not. lam entirely out
of the race as far as any elective office is
concerned.
"As to steel, iron and ship-building I
have been so long out of the country that
I am not as well posted on these matters
as I would like to be. I can say, how
ever, that the price of both steel and iron
is abnormally high Just now. owing to the
demand for manufacturing and other pur
poses. This demand has been merely the
logical result of the general forward
movement in all lines of business activ
ity. As these two articles are at the bot
tom of all manufacture, their price nat
urally goes up in proportion to demand
created by Increased activity in manufac
turing. These prices will not last through
the year. They have merely been created
by the sudden boom that has followed
the previous depression, and they will
soon sink to something more normal In
its nature I don't mean by this that the
prices will po down to where they were
before the advent of good times.- I mean
that they will get to somewhere nearer
reasonable figures.
"Shlp-bulldlng is rood, but would be bet
ter were it not for the price of steel and
iron, which is so largely used in construc
tion. We require more tonnage and we
have the yards and mechanics to supply
It; but at present wÂ« are waiting for the
cost of material to come within the proper
bounds before going ahead at the rate, we
should like to.
"I look for these favorable conditions In
prices to come within the present year,
and then the Bhlp-bulldlng Industry will
po forward with a spurt all over the
United States."

Arthur Sewall Speaks
on Politics.
INFLUENCE OF CONDITIONS
Arthur M. Sewall. the multi-millionaire
thlp-bullder and famous silver advocate,
who has recently returned from the Ha
waiian Islands, when been yesterday and
questioned on the general condition of
business throughout the country, said:
"The general condition of business all
over the country is goodâ more prosper
ous, In fact, than it has been before in
years. Not only is this true of the condi
tion of trade in the United' States proper,
but the same good times pertain in our
tiewly acquired colonies and island pos
sessions. *
"I have Just returned from the Ha
waiian Islands, and things will boom
there as soon as Congress gives them a
regular form of government. The islands
ere Buffering to-day for want of
Congressional action. As soon as
the United States gives Hawaii a terri
torial form of government that will con
duct affairs under an American policy,
the new Territory will develop into one
of the most prosperous and best paying
properties we own.
"Honolulu, when Americanized and
cleaned up, will become the most popular
resort in this hemisphere. Aside from the
t&lsnds, the entire country is being swept
for the second best man, and he was
Thomas R. Bard.
Dunlap of Stockton declared the good
feeling of the supporters of Irving M.
Scott. Said he: â¢ . '
I voted during the first ssssion for a man
whose name is known throughout the land, a
man who Is famous for his wGrks and whom
I considered worthy to be California's repre
sentative In Congress. Under similar circum
stances I would vote for him again, .but the
conditions are changed and another man has
appeared as the choice of the people, and
bowing to their will it is my pleasure to sec
ond his nomination. Thomas R. Bard of Ven
tura is the choice of a majority of this Legis
lature and my faith In him is as great aB in
any candidate who has come before us. I
wish to add my voice to the chorus that Is
going up for him.
LARDNER SPEAKS FOR
THE OLD BARNES MEN
Assemblyman Lardher of Placer spoke
for the old Barnes supporters as follows:
Mr. Speaker and Members of the Assembly ;
You will all witness that I was a consistent
follower of that fearless and honorable W. H.
L. Barnes during the last session. On ac
count of infirmities I can simply say that the
friends of General W. H. L. Barnes resolved
to land him not only as a man to represent
one section of the State, but to represent the
whole State of California, but the time naa
come for every man who loves his State and
his party to lay aside personal preferences and
act for the good of his State and the great
partyâ the Republican party of the State of
California. Very often we resort to a second
choice and the Republican party away back
in Washington demands that this great State
should be fully recognized. Our. people began
to realize that, the time had- come that this
demand should be carried out. The Governor,
of the State eald it would be a crime if we
were not represented. It is needless to say
that all the trade of the Orient may come to
our ports, that we are asked to insure pur
ports, and that it becomes. a duty, a Bolemn
i duty, to assist In Â¦ bringing about this most
' happy result. We feel that the time has come
when we must lay aside our party feelings and
we must get together and select a United
States Senator. I have consulted a great many
of my constituents In Placer County. and they
are perfectly satisfied, and so I can say that
it gives me the most supreme pleasure to
second the nomination of- the Hon.- TMomas R.
Bard for United States Senator in the Con
gress of the Untied Statea. -- Â¦ Â¦
GROVE JOHNSON DOES
SOME EXPLAINING
Grove LÂ«. Johnson, who has been one of
Colonel Burns' closest and most persistent
supporters, took advantage of the lull that
followed the applause t^, not only. second
Bard's nomination but to state his -own
position and that of Burns! -: He denounced
as unwarranted, by fact ,the. charges that
have been made against his' former can
didate and upheld him ,as a man fit in
every respect for the high position to
which he aspired. He asserted that he
had voted for him through the first fight
and would cheerfully do so again should
the occasion arise.
But with the Introduction of Mr. Bard, said
Mr. Johnson, we saw before vis two ways
one to do as others did during .the last ses
sion and create what is known as a deadlock:
the other to elect a. Senator from California
and uphold the Republican party. Our can
didate, we saw, could not win the fight and
not being an obstructionist he withdrew and
made the election of Thomas R. Bard pos
sible. It Is -now my pleasure to second that
gentleman's nomination.
BARD DECLARED THE
IDEAL BY MELICK
Assemblyman Mellck epoke as follows:
Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Assembly:
These closing months of the greatest century
of all ages are tilled with marvelous changes
In the affairs of mankind. The genius of men
and the activities of nations have compelled
historians and geographers to glide their pens
swiftly in 'order to record the transformations
wrought by art, by science, by Industry and
by war.
Foremost among the nations thus moving for
ward tp nobler i achievements and a grander
destiny stands the United States. While un
dertaking by a wise Industrial policy to beÃtow
peace and prosperity on all within her borders,
ehe la also carrying the blessings of liberty
abroad. Yonder In the populous isles < of these
western seas we are struggling to pacify, to
educate, to civilize and to uplift.
These are j^tlrrlng -times. In the
western pathway .of commercial, moral
and national development under the Anglo-
Saxon banner stands California, fruttful in
products, rich In resources and boundless In
possibilities. If we will but rise equal to the
occasion and appropriate the opportunities
within our reach. . ,
Although the nation has been in ,the throes
of external war and internal industrial devel
opment, and although California Is In the path
way of this Oriental trade, yet for nearly a
year Bhe has sat as a half-orphan In the high
est council of the nation. '.
For thirteen months we' have experienced a
most bitter contest in seeking a United States
Senator who will fully represent California in
the sisterhood of States. Personal prejudices,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Feb. Â«.â ln the selec
tion of Thomas R. Bard as the junior
United States Senator from California Los
Angeles is again honored In having for
two consecutive terms a representative in
the national Senate. Thomas R. Bard has
been a resident of this city for nearly two
years, his wife and family being now
domiciled in 957 West Adams street,
the fashionable residence section. This
information has not become generally
public. -. .-; ,
When Mrs. Bard was seen to-night she
stated that Mr. Bard had informed her
of the result of - to-day's balloting and
that many friends had tendered tele
graphic congratulations. "I shall expect
my husband about Saturday," Mrs. Bard,
in. response to on inquiry, said, "but I
know nothing of his intentions,' although
it was understood when he went to Sac
ramento that should he become the choice
of his party he would start for Washing
ton as soon as his business affairs could
be arranged. I do not expect to go to
Washington with Mr. Bard, and as far
as our plans are now known none of the
family will go. Whether Mr. Bard has
accepted any of the invitations that have
been extended to him I am unable to say.
but it will be fair to presume that he will
respond to the requests that it is reported
have been made by the citizens or Los
Angeles."

KRUGER TO BLAME,
DECLARES ASQUITH
LONDON. Feb. 6.â ln the House of
Commons to-day, replying to a question
of John Dillon. Nationalist member for
East Mayo, as to whether the Government
intended to treat food stuffs as contra-
band during the present war and if so un
der what restrictions and limitations, Mr.
Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury, said
that food stuffs, as such, had never been
considered contraband by Great Britain.
But, he added, f%od stuffs intended to
fcupply the army In the field were, by the
universal consent of international law
yers, regarded as contraband, and a prize
court would decide the facts connected
with the shipments.
Asked If the Government Intended to
direct cruisers to seize all cargoes for
Lourenzo Marquez until their character
was determined by a prize court, Mr. Bal
four declined to make any statement in
this connection.
George W. Wyndham. Parliamentary
Secretary for the War Office, re
plying to a question, said there
was reason to .believe that many
of the guns from the forts at Pre
toria had been sent to the front, and that
some of them had a range of over 10,000
yards. The British siege train sent out
in December, he added, had guns of equal
range. *
The debate on the amendment to the
address in reply to the speech from the
throne was resumed by H. H. Asquith.
Liberal (Home Secretary in the Rosebery
Ministry), who from the tenor of his re
marks might have held a brief for the
Government. He maintained that the war
was neither intended nor desired by the
Government, which naturally explained
the country's unpreparedness. Asquith
added that the war could have been
avoided by President Kruger accepting
the proposals made in September, which,
according to the speaker, were perfectly
Compatible with the maintenance of the
independence of the Transvaal and a
proper installment of long delay in justice
to the British population. If he thought
the British negotiations were a mere
cloak to attack the Independence of or an
nex the Transvaal, then in spite of the in
vasion of British territory and the loss of
British lives he could not have reconciled
his conscience with voting a penny for the
prosecution of the war. But that is not
the opinion of the House of Commons
nor of the great majority of the country.
That was why they were united in Par
liament and a united people. Doubtless
there had been a demonstrable lack of
foresight and insight. Chamberlain, no
doubt, would give much for a chance of
re-editing his dispatches. But there was
no ground in anything which had hap
pened, or anything which he could con
template at present, for the "croakings"
of pessimists or the outbursts of panic.
Th* speech of Asquith almost caused a
sensation in the House. Asquith repre
sents the Roseberyites. and Lord Rose
bery was present in the gallery to hear
him. The debate for some time after the
conclusion of Mr. Asquith's remarks was
very flat.
Answering a question before the House
of Commons, A. J. Balfour. the Govern
ment leader, said there was no truth In
'.he story of Major General Sir William
Butler's communications to Sir Alfred
Milner. the British High Commissioner to
South Africa, as published by the Man
chester Guardian to-day. According to
the story referred to^ Major General But
ler, the former commander of the Brit
ish forces In South Africa, objected to re
inforcing the border garrisons, and said
that SO.uX) men should be on hand at the
outbreak of the war, even if it was con
fined to .-*'.,= South African republic.
John Burns, Radical member for Bat
tersea, congratulated the opposition on
having the courage to do its duty, "un
influenced by newspapers owned by black
guards and edited by ruffians who clamor
lor war." He characterized it as absurd
to say that the debate would be an en
couragement and an incentive to the
Boers.
"The Boers don't need an incentive,"
exclaimed Burns. '"This was supplied
them years ago by the blundering policy
of the Colonial Secretary, whose speech
might be fairly summarized? as follows:
'There is no argument for war. There
fore wave the Union Jack. A few mis
takes have been committed. Therefore
double your army In South Africa.' "
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the
Liberal leader. Justified the opportune
ness of the amendment, because it was
the duty of the opposition to record its
judgment. He said the Government would
hardly pose as conquerors upon whose
brows laurel wreaths should be placed,
for their diplomacy had failed and their
military operations had been unsuccessful.
These facts. Sir Henry declared. Invited
criticism. At the same time he would
deprecate exaggeration and would deny
the existence of national humiliation and
discomfiture. He also denied that the
opposition was actuated by a desire to
clamber into power or to seek party ad
vantage. The "composed and sensible
tone of the speech of the Colonial Secre
tary," he haa been glad to hear. If the
Government were aware of the disparity
between the defensive forces of the South
African colonies and the military strength
of the Boers when the negotiations were
entered upon, no condemnation, in his
judgment, could be too severe. Sir Henry
ridiculed Lord Salisbury's statement that
the secret service fund was too small and
pointed out that the whole sum had not
been expended. He thought the Govern
ment should have disavowed the Jameson
raid and given guarantees for the future,
as Great Britain would have then been in
a position to demand that Boers cease
arming.
Sir Henry demanded to know upon what
evidence the existence of a Dutch con
spiracy was asserted, declaring that, un
less the charge was well founded, it was a
most wanton insult to her Majesty's loyal
Dutch subjects at the Cape. The war
must be prosecuted with vigor, he main
tained, but provided British territories
were free and Great Britain's military su-
Deriority was vindicated, what mattered

it as to the hour anu Dlace of arriving at
a settlement. (Loud ministerial protests.)
What really did matter was,- he affirmed,
that the settlement should be made in
the right spirit.
Mr. Balfour, who on rising was loudly
cheered, said:
"What is the obpect of the amendment?
What is it likely to attain? One might
have expected that the War Office would
be attacked, but that is not the case. I
am driven to the conclusion that the
amendment is an attack upon the Colo
nial Secretary. ("Hear, hear!") Well, the
Colonial Secretary may well ignore these
persistent attacks. -The right honorable
gentleman may remember that it has been
during his term of office as Colonial 'Sec
retary that the British Empire, as a
whole, has first shown its full conscious
ness of what it is and of what its des
tinies are. (Loud cheers.) Others have
certainly contributed to this result, but it
Is in no small degree owing to the great
administrative abilities of the right hon
orable gentleman, the Colonial Secretary,
that the dramatic moment has occurred,
for the first time in our history, when
every British colony has joined the
mother country to carry out a great Im
perial work, and when all these petty and
contemptible charges are buried in the
oblivion they so well deserve, the name
of the right honorable gentleman will for
ever be associated with the great move
ment In our history."
Mr. Balfour went on to accuse the op
position of wishing to oust the Govern
ment, a suggestion that was received
with considerable lauchter. He com
mented upon the diversity of views in the
opposition ranks.
"Is the opposition," he asked, "wise or
patriotic? What the country has to ' fear
is foreign nations,- and the Transvaal
politicians may think they can find their
opportunity in our dissensions. The
House of Commons cannot do much to
help our arms, but this it can do â It can
show that behind our soldiers in the field
there is a united country. (Loud cheers.)
"Can the members of the opposition re
flect with equanimity on the fact that
the vote they are about to give upon the
amendment may lengthen the war and
increase the tragic list of losses, and
probably add one fraction to the chances
of European complications?"
Mr. Balfour, in closing, appealed to the
members of the House, irrespective of
party, to rise to "the height reached by
those we represent." He declared that if
they did this, then in a short time the
empire would issue from th*Â« struggle
"stronger not only in the consciousness
of its strength but in the eyes of the civ
ilized world." Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦Â« â¢
He resumed his scat amid prolonged
cheering. . When the division bell rang
the Irish members rose in a body and left
the House without voting. Several Lib
erals abstained. Some others voted with
the Government", as did also Sir Edward
Clarke, membfer for Plymouth. Mr. As
quith voted with Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman for the amendment.
At the close of Mr. Balfour's speech
Lord Edmund Fltzmaurice's amendment
to the address in reply to the' speech from
the throne was rejected by 352 against
the amendment to 139 in its favor.

THE STARS AS TIMEKEEPERS.
They Are Much More Reliable Than
the Sun. :
Probably the majority of people sup
pose that the observatories obtain the
correct time from the sun. When the av
erage man wishes to give his watch the
highest praise he says "It regulates the
sun," not being aware that a watch which
would keep with the sun around the year
would have to be nearly as bad as Cap'n
Cuttle's. The farmer may safely decide
when to go in to dinner by the sun. but if
the mariner was as confident that the
sun marked always the correct time as
the farmer is he would be sure to be at
times two or three hundred miles from
where he thought he was. In other words,
the sun â that is, a sun dialâ is only cor
rect on a few days In each year, and dur
ing the intervening times gets. as far as
a whole quarter hour fast or slow.
These variations of the sun from uni
form time caused no end of trouble be
tween the astronomers and the fine clock
makers before it was discovered that the
sun time Is subject to such irregularities.
The better the clock the worse it often
seemed to go. . .-
But as the variations In sun time are
now accurately known correct time might
be obtained from the sun by making
proper allowance were it not for the dif
ficulty of observing its position with suf
ficient exactness. The large disk of the
sun cannot be located as perfectly as can
the single point which a star make 3. For
this reason astronomers depend almost
wholly upon the stars for obtaining accu
rate time. It is the method of doing this
winch we propose to describe.
There are several hundred stars whose
positions have been established with the
greatest accuracy by the most careful
observations at a number of the prin
cipal observatories ,of the world. If a
star's exact position is known it can read
ily be calculated when it will cross the
meridian of any. given placeâ that is, the
instant it will cross a north and south line
through the place.' The data regarding
these stars are all published in the nauti
cal almanacs, which are got out by sev-

A RESTAURANT EPISODE.
A Sort of Straw Vote.
An advertising agent, representing a
prominent New York . magazine, while on
a recent "Western trip, was dining- ono
evening in a Pittsburg restaurant.
"While waiting for his order he glanced
over his newspaper and noticed the ad-
vertisement of a well-known dyspepsia
preparation, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
As he himself was a regular user of tha
tablets he began speculating as to how
many of the other traveling men in tho
dining-room were also friends of the pop-
ular remedy for indigestion.

at the tables and In the hotel office I toolc
the trouble to Interview them and was
surprised to learn that nine of the twen-
ty-three made a practice of taking one
or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets af-
ter each mea!.
"One of them told me he had suffered so
much from stomach trouble that at ono
time he had been obliged to quit tha
road, but since using Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets had been entirely free from in-
digestion, but he continued their use. es-
pecially while traveling, on account of Ir-
regularity in meals and because. like all
traveling men, he was often obliged to
eat what he could get and not always
what he wanted.
"Another, who looked the picture of
health, saijl he never ate a meal without
taking a Stuart Tablet afterward because
he could eat what he pleased and when
he pleased, without fear of a sleepless
night or any other trouble.
Still another used them because he wa3
subject to gas on stomach, causing pres-
sure on heart and lungs, shortness of
breath and distress in chest, which he no
longer experienced since using the. tablets
regularly. ' ."-
"Another claimed that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets was the only eofa remedy
he had ever found for sour stomach and
acidity. He had formerly U3ed common
soda to relieve the trouble, but the tablets
were much better and safer to use."

THREATENS THE BOER
RIGHT AT MAGERSFONTEIN
LONDON. Feb. 7. 4:20 a. m.â Lord Rob
erts has* caused to be distributed In the
towns bordering upon the invaded colo
nial territory an Invitation to Free Stat
ers .and Transvaalers to go Into the des
ert, offering them good treatment and a
restoration to their farms on the British
occupation of republican territory- The
manifesto guarantees that those bringing
horses can sell them. Foreigners will
have their passage paid to Europe. Co
lonial rebels are advised to surrender in
preference to being taken prisoners.
General Mac Donald, with 4000 infantry,
cavalry and artillery, threatens the Boer
right at Magersfontein. This is the first
sign of activity, on the part of Lord Me
thuen for some weeks and doubtless has
relation to the movements of the British
farther east. "
The Standard has received the follow
ing dispatch, dated Monday, February 5,
from Koppies Dam:
"General Mac Donald, with a brigade of
Infantry, a regiment of lancers and one
battery, has reached here from Modder
River camp, in what Is regarded as an
important movement to the right of the
Boer position at Magersfontein. Koppies
Dam commands the roads from Klmber
ley to Hopetown and Douglass. Two
Boer laagers, at Kamulhoek and Griqua
town, are within striking distance. The
arrival of General Mac Donald's column
was opportune, as it just prevented twb
large commandos effecting a luncture.
He now holds both banks of the river.
The lancers had two brushes with the
Boer patrols. There is great activity
among the enemy and strong forces are
concentrated to oppose our further ad
vance. The troops suffered from heat and
scarcity of water during the march."
WILKINSON'S MOST
SEVERE CRITICISM
LONDON, Feb. 7.â ln the absence of
war news this morning Spencer "Wilkin
son in the. Morning Post discusses the
problem of arming the nation at home.
He says:
"There is now such Intense and wide
spread interest in the army and its man
agement that the nation will have itself
to thank if the solving of the problem
should not be the history of the next few
months."
Ho proceeds to argue that "conscription
would be valueless unless the general
management of the army .were first re
modeled." On this point he says:
"A war office that for thirty years has
not known what to do with the volun
teers would not know what to do with the
half a million conscripts."
Mr. Wilkinson also discusses the use
of the bayonet, remarking:
"This weapon very seldom comes into
actual use. Its effect Is on the spirits of
both sides rather than on the bodies of
either. The British by using formations
fit for charging, but ndt for shooting.

cers of the San Francisco Fly-casting
Club was held last night in the assembly
room, Mills building. AValter D. Mans
field, who has done so much toward the
development of the pastime of fly-casting,
was- re-elected to the presidency. The
other officers are: F. H. Reed, vice presi
dent; Horace Smyth, secretary; Herman
Muller, treasurer, Charles Huyck was
appointed acting secretary in the absence
of Mr. Smyth in the East. The executive
committee consists of Colonel George C.
Edwards, James S. Turner, John P. Bab
cock, Edward Everett and C. G. Young.
Tha . rules governing . contests and the
dates for this year's competitions, aa sug
gested by the executive committee, were
adopted with only minor changes. The
tendency throughout was to raise the
standard required to qualify for the vari
ous classes and to place the pastime on a
still higher plane. The contests will be
held at Stow Lake on the second and
fourth Saturday and Sunday in each
month until the Ist of October.
It was decided that contestants shall be
allowed five minutes to cast for distance,
with no time allowance for replacing a
lost fly. It was found that on an average
only half this time was required. To cor
rect an abuse which might develop it was
decided that not more than sixty feet of
line, including leader, shall be extended
beyond the tip of the rod when contest
ant makes his first cast. Contestants will
not be allowed to extend their lines along
the bank of the lake more than sixty feet
during the casting. =-.
A. E. Lovett was made captain of the
Saturday contests and T. W. Brotherton
captain of those held on Sunday.
Dr. W. E. Brooks was elected a member,
while other names were received and
placed on the waiting list. The member
ship reached the limit of 100 some time
since, and, -like public servants, few die
and. none resign.

FIGHT AGAINST THE
POOLROOMS RENEWED
Citizens of Sausalito Very Much In
terested in the Forthcoming
Municipal Election.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAUSALITO, Feb. 6.-Â«-Hlll tribe and
water front will shortly war on the ques
tion as to whether or not the poolrooms
are to run here this summer. Three mem
bers of the present Board of- Trustees-
John H. Dickinson, Dr. C. H. Crumpton
and J. Majorhausen, all sturdy supporters
of the poolroom cohortsâ have signified
their intention of retiring. At last night's
meeting of the board a resolution was
passed calling for the election of three
Trustees, Marshal, Clerk, and Treasurer,
to be held some time next month.
Trustee Sylva, the most notorious friend
of the Harvey-Harrison clique, states em
phatically that the places vacated by the
trio will be filled with a water front ticket
of gamblers' supporters. Who these are
Sylva refuses to state. On the other hand,
the hill-tribe contingent are equally con
fident of driving out the sports and enter
tain no doubt but that victory will perch
upon their banners. As the poolroom pro
prietors last year made an avowed profit
of $00,000 there is no likelihood of their
letting such a prize go without a struggle.
The election promises to be one of the
most exciting ever held here, as both sides
are determined to fight the matter to the
bitter end.

PICTURES WILL TELL THE
STORY OF A GREAT FIGHT
JEFFRIES AWAITS THE ONSET OF SHARKEY.
From a copyright photograph by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company
THE . pictures of the championship fight between Jeffries and Sharkey
In the arena of the Coney Island Sporting Club on November 3 last will
be shown for the first time in this city at the Alhambra Theater next
Sunday afternoon. The film secured at the ringside by tho American
Biograph Company contains 216,000 distinct pictures, it being over seven miles
long.
The fight, from the time the first man entered the ring until the end came,
lasted just .100 minutes. Every move made by the principals in that time
is depicted on the screen. According to the friends of Sharkey, the sailor
received the worst of the decision from Referee Siler. In support of this
claim they offer the pictures of the fight in evidence. The pictures will
be shown afternoon and evening for two weeks. To. persons who have
never seen a prize-fight these views should prove of especial Interest.
The whole scene. is spread out before them vividly, lacking only the sounds
of the blows and the cries of the spectators to complete the effect. Â»'-

COURT NOTES.
Louise G. Kennedy was yesterday given
judgment by a Jury in Judge Hunt's court
against John Lee for $10,000. Lee, It was
proven, was the holder of mining stock
valued at $100,000, in which the plaintiff
had an interest valued at $10,000. The
mine, on which the entire valuation of
the stock was- placed, was recently sold
to Hayward & Lane, and the plaintiff
then demanded her share of the proceeds.
Her claim was repudiated and she filed
suit with the result as stated. .
Whether or not jurors when deliberat
ing on verdicts are entitled to their meals
will be determined soon by reason of a
precedent established by Judge Cook yes
terday. Ernest Fuhrman, charged with
the crime of grand larceny, occupied the
attention of a jury yesterday, and when
the hour for the noon meal arrived the
court, ordered the Sheriff to take the
twelve good men and true to luncheon.
A plea was made by the Sheriff that as
the charter made no provision for jurors'
meals if he fed them he would be out
that much in pocket. The court was ob
durate, however, and ordered the jurors
fed, and said that in event the Sheriff
failed to obey the order of court he would
call upon the Coroner to arrest him for
contempt of court. This threat had the
desired result, and now the Sheriff must
sue the city to recover the amount ex
pended in purchasing a banquet for the
jurors of Cook's court.
FIXED THE DUES OF THE
COMMERCIAL MUSEUM
ADVTSOBY COMMITTEE PASSES
ON GOVERNING BULES.
Discussed the Question of Delin
quents and the Bights of Mem
bers Who Go Out of
Business.
The advisory committee of the Pacific
Commercial Museum Committee on pro
motion met at S o'clock yesterday after
noon at the Board of Trade rooms to i
finally adopt the rules of government for
the proposed institution.
To provide for the raising of funds to
carry out the project it was decided that
the promotion committee should appoint
a finance committee, consisting of nine
members and sixty additional ones to so
licit subscriptions. These solicitors will
operate all over the Pacific Coast.
At the opening of the meeting a letter
from William P. Wilson, one of the direc
tors of the Philadelphia Commercial Mu
seum, was read. It extended the courte
sies of that body to any committee the
San trancisco organization might send
there.
The most discussion was held on the
subject of Initiation fees and dues. Mr. I
de Vouag'f idt-a. that members outside
this city should pay only half what those
residing here paid was voted down, it be
ing the opinion of the majority of those
present that all members should pay
alike. The dues were finally fixed at *6 a
month for all members, and a rule was
adopted that when any one was three
months In arrears he could be expelled at
the discretion of the board of governors,
which board could then proceed to en
force the payment by the defaulting mem
ber of all money due up to the end of his
Jive-year contract. It was decided that
the initiation fee Fhould be $C 0 to any one
Joining before the formal opening of the
museum and $IW> after that. This, It was
thought, would cause interested parties
to join at once. Dues will not begin to be
payable until after the opening, which it
was decided should take, place one year
from now.
The clause providing that no special
privileges- nor information should be fur
nished any one was adopted, with the
amendment that those caring to pay addi
tional for such privileges and information
could have them.
Mr. Sachs urged that a rule be adopted
providing that no member nor person go
ing out of business should be compelled
to pay dues afterward. He said some
firms and business men would not join
unless this was agreed to. This rule was
adopted.
The clause giving city members special
privileges in the matter of voting was
amended so all members could have equal
rights in that line.
The committee decided that the first
president, vice president and board of
governors should be Hected by the pro
moters ard should hold office for one,
year after the formal opening, after which
twenty -one governors should be elected,
seven of them to go out of office each
year.
ANDRISA A
SPRINTER OF
SOME CLASS
Proved an Easy Winner of
the Handicap at Oakland.
Record Lowered.
The three-year-old filly Andrisa, owned
by "Mike" Fox, the Celtic wit of Rancho
del Paso, exhibited her speed to excellent
advantage in the six-furlong handicap at
Oakland yesterday. Trained by Walter
Jennings, the 109 pounds rested very light
ly on her back, and a- 13 to 10 favorite,
she won with Spencer holding her in re
serve. Ben Ledi, after racing Frank Bell
to a standstill, stayed with her work
gamely, downing Loving Cup a neck for
place.
Followers of favorites had nothing to
complain of,; aa four choices scampered
In before their fields. The weather was
warm and the track faster than on the
preceding day. . >' Â¦'â¢ .
Quite recently Dogtown showed to some
advantage in a race, and in the opening
run- the bay horse went to the post a
9 to 5 choice, played down from 4. Plg
gott soon ha&>-him in front and he won
ridden out a length before ! the 10 to 1
shot Twinkle TwTnk. The show fell to
New Moon.
In the two-year-old dash Tom Griffin's
filly, Laura Marie, was brought to a hard
drive to beat the 30 to 1 shot. Corn Cake,
a nose. The winner was a 3 to 5 favorite,
and in doing tho trick lowered the coast
record for three and a half furlongs to
41^ seconds. Count Hubert, the second
choice, ran a fair third. r - V Â¦ Â¦
Tuthlll looked the best of the eight
starters in the third event, receiving
heavy support at odds of 4 to 5. At the
end Redwald gave the first choice quite
an argument, but the last few yards
Stfencer, on the former, gave it up, losing
by a length. Show honors fell to Allenna.
Quoted at 10 to 1 during one stage of
the betting. Rio Chico led from start to
finish in the mile and a furlong selling
affair. The chestnut received nice hand
ling at Jenkins' hands, winning by a
length without punishment. Behind him

it out, short heads apart, in the order
named. * _

Track Notes.
W. J. Spiers, well known as the owner
TOMMY BURNS
IS SEVERELY
DEALT WITH
The California Jockey Club
Stewards Restrict His
Riding to Schorr Stable.
The touch of San Francisco high Ufa In
dulged in by Jockey Tommy Burn*, the
crack light-weight of the Middle West,
was pleasant and invigorating, but aa
events have developed altogether too ex
pensive. At a meeting held last evening
by. the board of stewards of the California
Jockey Club the riding of Burns. was re
stricted to the firms of Burns & W.ater
house and John F. Schorr & Son to May
4, and for the balance of the year
Tommy can pilot the horses of the Schorr
stable only. This ruling means the loss
of many hundreds of dollars to the young?
man, as- his services were In g^eat de
mand on the other side of the Rockies,
where he Is a big public favorite.
Burns is under contract to tho Mem
phis firm of J. F. Schorr & Son. at a
large yearly salary. Under the terms of
a special agreement the Jockey was al
lowed to come to California and ride for
Burns & Waterhouse, that firm enjoying
first call, even though the Memphis turf
men sent a stable here to race. Burns
scored a pronounced hit on his first ap
pearance at Oakland, immediately becom
ing a turf idoL Then . there came a re
action. His work became slovenly, and
It was hinted about that Tommy was a
too frequent starter in midnight handi
caps. To his credit, however, it can be
said, he did not pick his mounts, appar
ently being willling to toss the leg up on
."any old kind of a horse" that looked to
have a chance.
Shortly before the close of 1599 Burns re
fused to ride Sly in a race at Oakland,
when ordered to do so by the Judges. In
stead ho donned his street clothes, took
an early boat across the bay, and the
next day left on a duck-hunting trip. For
this breach, of turf etiquette he was indef
initely suspended, and until last evening
his fate was held in the balance. A ride
Tommy furnished on Dr. Bernays, when
that horse ruled favorite in the "betting on
December 23 last, caused considerable ad
verse comment at the time, and at last
night's investigation the rider was close
ly questioned in regard to it.
Among those called by the stewards
was Charley Ellison, the close friend and
adviser of Burns," who stated that on the
day Dr. Bernays was defeated he had bet
$200 on the horse. Ellison felt much down
cast over the trouble Burns found him
self in, and says he tried hard to get
Tommy to mend his ways. He made none
of the boy's engagements and seemed
more grieved over the whole affair than
the disciplined rider himself.
At the same meeting the stewards made
the suspension against Albert Songer In
definite. Songer was set down for sev
eral lazy looking saddle efforts.
FIGHTERS
STILL FAIL
TO AGREE
National Club's Increased Bid
Does Not Tempt Cor
bett's Manager.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NITW YORK, Feb. 6.â Where thÂ© light
between Jeffries and Corbett will take
place Is still a matter of doubt. Brady
produced a telegram from Gibbs of San
Francisco raising the bid of the National
Athletic Club of that city to 75 per cent,
and claimed that as that was the highest
bid and as the club had deposited a certi
fied check for $2500 the National Club was
entitled to the" battle, according to the
articles of agreement. It developed that
Brady held a half interest in the National
Athletic Club, and he acknowledged that
fact, but said it had no bearing on the
situation.
Manager Consldine held that an offer
of CO per cÂ»nt from any club in or near
this city would be a better one than the
offer of even 90 per cent from any Cali
fornia club.
In regard to Considlne'B charge that
Jeffries was about to take an unfair ad
vantage of Corbett by going to San Fran
cisco at once, so as to become acclimated,
Brady said he would sign an agreement
that Jeffries would not arrive in San
Francisco until Corbett did.
Manager Considine said he would advise
Corbett not to fight in San Francisco.
It is expected that Considine will put In
a satisfactory offer from the Seaside Ath
letic Club at to-morrow's meeting. Man
ager Considine explains his position in
the following letter:
SineÂ» the close of bids for the Jeffries-Cor
bett flKht on . Friday, I have learned from a
very reliable source that two big bids which
came from the Carnival Athletic Club and the
National Athletic Club, both of San Francisco,
were prearranged affairs instituted by "Billy"
Brady, who, 1 am informed, is Interested In
both clubs. Â¦-â¢-.
My informant also tells me that Jeffries,
who is at present at Hot Springs, will leave
In a day or so for San Francisco to get accli
mated so as to.be fit and strong to flfiht Cor
bett, should by any chance the battle be fought
there. '
.As Corbett' s manager, I am opposed to Â«iy
man nehtin* In San Fran.clsoo, thousands of
miles from this olty. The contest should be
fought In this vicinity. â¢â¢ * 'Â¦â¢
My reason for making this statement is that
I firmly believe the otters "of the Broadway
Athletic Club and the Seaside â¢ Athletic Club
of fiO per cent of the gross receipts are better
Incentives by lonr odds than 90 per cent, or
even a $20,000 purse, offered by California clubs,
and no one is . better acquainted with that' fact
than Mr. Brady. i ;
If Jeffries is sincere In his desire to fight
Corbett. why doesn't he box him In New York
instead of Ean Francisco?
This contest I consider the most Important
of either CorbetVs or Jeffrie* 1 ' career. I leave
It to 'the s-eneral public If I am not right in
my demand. GEORGE F. CONSIDINB.

MIDWINTER SPORTING EVENTS
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY. FEBRUARY 7, 1900.
THIS CITY WILL
KEEP THE TRADE.
OF BAKERSFIELD
Los Angeles Defeated
on Tariff.
VALLEY RATES NOT CHANGED
Â«
LABGE VOLUME OF BUSINESS AT
STAKE.
The objectionable railway 'tariff that
would have practically shut San Francis
co out of the trade of Bakersfield and t;it=
criminated against this city as far norrh
in the San Joaquin Valley us Modesto will
not go into effect. Dispatches bringing
the news were received yesterday morning
from Messrs. Stubbs. Sproule and Bissell,
representing the Southern Pacific and
Sasta Fe roads. A teleprara received by
A. A. Watkins of the Boara of Tra.'.e
from J. C. Stubbs was as follows: "Pro
posed tariff to San Joaquin Valley points
will Dot be adopted. Publication was a
mistake." A joint dispatch was also re
eclvfd from Messrs. Bif=KÂ»>ll and Sproule,
which read: "Proposed tariff to which you
object will not be put in force." Similar
dispatches were sent to the Chamber of
Commerce and the Manufacturers' eirl
Producers' Association, those organiza
tions having united with the Board of
Trade in making: protest against the
tariff.
- This Fettles the matter, and also bring*
to a close an Interesting chapter of rail
way history in the State. Before the Val
ley road was operated to Bakersfield LjoÂ»
Angeles had an advantage in the matter
of freights over San Francisco, and so
was able to do a considerable business in
the San JotKjuin Valley. The Valley road
<Hd this city a service in lowering the
rates to Bakorsfuld. Recently the Ban
Francisco merchants have had an advan
tage on one class of freight and Los An
geles an advantage on another. About a
yoar ego the lx>s Anpeles merchants in
effectively tried to persuade the Southern
Pacific Company to put into effect sub
stantially the fsme tariff that by reason
of the. protest made by San Francisco has
just been shelved.
â¢ The- interests, involved are larger than
mig-ht be guessed by a casual .reader. It
is estimated by a;merchant, who is w-11
informed, that the trade of Bakersfteld
alone Is worth from IUEOOjOOO to-$2,000.Â»K>
to San Francisco per annum. The trade
of other points which were affected by the
tariff Is equally large, and San Francisco
stood to lose net less than $4/Â»0,000 in its
annual volume- of trade. The Los Angeles
people, already sore over the routing ques
tion, will be disappointed at the result of
the attempt to take away the trade terri
tory of San Francisco.

SEEKS TO FASTEN
GUILT ON CORNISH
Molineux Defense Calls
No Witnesses.
NEW TORK. Feb. 6.â Counsel for Ro
land Molineux, charged with having: mur
dered Mrs. Katherine J. Adams by poison
sent to Harry Cornish in December, 1593.
took a bold and unexpected step to-day,
announcing that the defense would sub
mit no evidence. Last night Barlow S.
Weeks, counsel for Molineux, stated that
the defense would consume less time than
the prosecution. It had been the general
expectation that many witnesses would
be called. Including handwriting Expert
Carvalho and a number of persons who
would attack the character of Harry
Cornish. QÂ£3B
Weeks began his summing up to-day
and had not finished when court ad
journed. He spoke with great earnest
ress and the jury listened to him intently.
He told of his long personal friendship
Â¦with Molineux and he attacked Harry
Cornish bitterly. The tenor of his argu
ment was that- the proofs pointed more
strongly to Cornish as the murderer than
to Molineux. MoUneux's father, mother
and wife were in court, as was Cornish,
who was visibly nervous. Molineux
seemed cool and collected.
"No testimony has been produced to
show that this defendant mailed this
package or was in the vicinity of the
Postofflce at 3:30 o'clock on December 23.
IS9S the day this package was mailed,
but." said Weeks, pausing an instant and
poisins his hand in the air while his eyes
swept over the jury, "Harry Cornish was,
and he was at the Postofflce at exactly
the time the package was mailed and on
that day. That silver bottle nolder was
bought by a man who said that he wanted
It "for a lady's dresser* and matched the
eilver on that dresser. There is not a
syllable of evidence or scintilla of proof
that that package ever came through the
mails, except Mr. Cornish's evidence.
Has he told the truth? This is important.
No one proves the receipt, no postman
proves the delivery, except Cornish."
Word by word Weeks went over the
Cornish testimony and strove to impress
upon the jury the suspicion that Cornish
might have "been guilty. He dilated on
the suspicious circumstances.
"Mrs. Adams took a dosÂ»e of medicine
and died. Mr. Cornish took a dose, or
cays he did, on an empty stomach and
wanders around all day with no evil ef
fect. He says he took a dose. He even
went to see Yocum. a man who knows
how to make cyanide of mercury. Now
what reasonable excuse did Cornish have
for visiting Yocum that day of all days?"
Week* then described MoUneux's actions
ever eince the newspapers accused him
as those of an innocent man. \veeks
asked for an adjournment until to-mor
row, his voice having failed. The jury
will be locked up to-night in the Astor
House. Weeks' address will consume all
of to-morrow. _.

GAVE NO BANQUET TO
COUNT DE CASTELLANE
French Embassador to Washington
Finds It Necessary to Correct a
Misapprehension.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 6.â An authorized
statement is made on the best authority
that all thai has been published in the
press concerning an alleged banquet of
fered by Embassador Cambon of France
to Count <le Castellane Is inaccurate. The
matter has attracted considerate atten
tion on both sides of the water, but the
discussion has proceeded on an entire mis
apprehension of the facts. It appears that
the French Embassador was present at an
informal luncheon at one of the fasnion
ebie restaurants of Nsw 'iork. at which
Count and Countess de Castellane were
also Invited. The affair was purely social
end has been given an Importance entirely
disproportionate to Its formal character.

REPUBLICAN LEAGUE
OF OREGON MEETS
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 6.â The Republi
can League of Oregon to-day held its
biennial session In this city, about SOO
delegates being present. The league
elected officers and fourteen delegates to
th National League. J. M. Church, a
banker of La Grande, was chosen presi
dent The following resolutions wero
adopted:
So long as either of the great political parties
advocates the free coinage of silver, the finan
cial question is the paramount question before
the American people. The Republican clubs
of the State of Oregon, in convention assem
bled, reaffirm their loyalty to the gold stand
ard and their opposition to the free coinage of
sliver.
We believe the best and mest stable dollar
in the world should be assured by legislation
to the laborer as the fruit of his toil and to
the farmer as the price of his crop. We are
in sympathy with the efforts of the Republican
Senators and Representatives in Congress to
enact legislation for this purpose.
We hereby heartily Indorse the Philippine pol
icy of the present administration. These islands
have been won by American blood and pur
chased by American treasure: they should re
main a permanent, part of our national domain.
We cannot neglect our duty to give them a
stable government, nor can we afford to throw
away the great opportunity they give us for
development of our Oriental trade.
The Republican party was formed for the
purpore of fighting the battle* of free labor.
Throughout its whole history it has been the
champion of the people and of the American
laborer In particular. We are opposed to the
monopolization of commerce and Industry by
trusts and are in favor of all Judicious legis
lation-looking to - the curtailment of their
power.
A resolution in favor of electing United
States Senators by a direct vote of the
people was adopted.
LAWS NEEDED TO
CHECK POLYGAMY
Appeal of Christians to
Congress.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 6.-The rooms of
the House Committee on Judiciary were
crowded to overflowing to-day with the
representatives of many religious, mis
sionary and social reform bodies to urge
the need of a constitutional amendment
prohibiting polygamy. Among those heard
were Bishop Satterlee. Episcopal Bishop
of Washington; Rev. Dr. Hamlin. In be
half of the Presbyterian church; Dr. S. H.
Green of the Baptist church. Mrs. Janes
for the Women's Home Missionary Board
of the Presbyterian church. Miss Jennie
Ackerman, traveling representative of the
Women's Christian Temperance Union;
Judge W. M. Springer of Indian Ter
ritory, Dr. John Dixon of New York and
Dr. L. A. Foote of Brooklyn.
The addresses were condemnatory of
polygamy, and many of those engaged in
missionary work in the West asserted that
the Mormon church was systematically
propagating the doctrine of polygamy,
despite all denials. The women speakers
appealed in particular for protection to
the sanctity of the American home.
Bishop Satterlee voiced the Episcopalian
sentiment by saying that the family was
the root of modern civilization, and be
earnestly supported this movement as one
In defense of the family and the home.
Rev. John Dixon of New York said the-
Mormon church was seeking to make a
virtue out of a vice and to establish this
vice as the cornerstone of religion.
Rev. T. S. Hamlin of the Church of the
Covenant, Washington, said that what
was feared was that with the disposition
of Roberts' case Congress would drop the
subject, whereas the religious sentiment
of the country wanted the movement to
bring forth a constitutional amendment

EXPANSION AND
ITS DRAWBACKS
Argument of Williams
in the House.
Â»
WASHINGTON. Feb. 6.â The Philippine
question again occupied the attention of
the House to-day, with a slight digression
concerning the war in South Africa. The
feature of the debate was the speech of
Williams of Mississippi, who presented an
argument against the annexation of the
Philippines which attracted much atten
tion. It was devoted almost entirely to
the commercial aspects of the acquisition,
holding that the absorption of the Islands
would be ultimately ruinous to the Ameri
can producers of cotton, rice, tobacco,
hemp and sugar. Morris of Minnesota
made an exhaustive legal argument in
support of the right to hold and govern
the islands. The other speakers wer3
Gibson of Tennessee, V%". A. and H. C.
Smith of Michigan, Cochran of Missouri
and Neville of Nebraska. The general de
bate on the diplomatic bill closed to-day
and to-morrow it will be taken up for
amendment under the five-minute rule.
Until the financial measure now ?pending
before the Senate shall have been dis
posed of finally it will be considered by
the Senate every legislative day to the
exclusion of all except purely routine
business. This agreement will have the
effect of cutting off all debate on the
Philippine question or other matters ex
cept by unanimous consent of the Senate
unless Senators choose to discuss other
questions in the time they devote to the
financial bill. Caffery of Louisiana con
cluded his speech on the Philippine ques
tion to-day, holding that the United
States ought to restore in the islands the
status quo and then confer Independence
upon the Filipinos.

DAWSON BEING DESERTED
IN THE RUSH TO NOME
Adverse Legislation in the Matter of Re
locating Claims Paralyzing Business
in the Klondike.
By SAM W. WALL.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DAWSOX, Jan. 9 (via Seattle. Feb. 6).â
Dawson Is suffering such an attack of
Nome fever that already the life has
cone out of the town. There are plenty
of living people here, to be sure, but they
are living upon the hope of being able to
ccc Nome. The only thought or the only
topic of conversation Is "The spring,''
"The breaking of the Ice in the river,"
that will enable them to move with
all they have to the new American
camp. Men are working on the creeks
at $5 a day In cash rather than ac
cept a higher wage "on bedrock"
cr "after the wash up." They want
money in hand so that they may be
free to leave the moment it Is possible to
do so by water. Merchants are closing
out their business already, and where this
time last year business places were in
demand ar.d rents goir.g up the sign. "To
let," meets one at every turn. Numbers
of men have left to make the long jour
ney of over two thousand miles over the
lee by dog team, and departures take
place nearly every day. The number will
Increase as the season progresses up to
the middle of February. The first of June
will find little of Dawson left but the
shell. Business is already dead here.
The past week has seen two of the
principal saloons close their doors perma
nently. Others will follow. The largest
of tho theaters and dance halls, the Pal
ace Grand, has closed, and the opera
house and Monte Carlo change hands
about every two weeks in a desperate ef
fort to fight o2 the inevitable. Charley
Meadows of San Francisco, known as
Arizona Charley, is proprietor of the Pal
ace Grand Theater. It is an immense
structure, with a large auditorium and
two tiers of boxes, ranging one above the
other, entirely round the house. He Is go-
Ing to undertake to .move the building
bodily as it stands to Nome. He has ac
tually let a contract for tho Job, and the
contractors have given bonds for its safe
delivery.
The building Is to be placed on four
large barges, to be built especially for the
purpose, and floated down the Yukon
to its mouth and thence, awaiting good
weather, towed by steamer to Nome.
The flight from Dawson In the spring
will far eclipse any stampede that ever
came this way. Literally everybody is
going who is .not too badly tied up here.
So uniform Is the rule that the man who
declares that he Is not going Is looked
upon as an oddity.
This condition of affair* is chargeable
entirely to pbnoxious legislation. The
Klondike is no longer a poor man's coun
try. The results of the years of pros
pecting and the location of pay streaks
have been taken away so far as the average
man Is concerned by a systematic course
of lawmaking directed in the interests of
the few. The recently adopted regulation
that prevents relocation of claims has
broken the camel's back. All claims now
located and that are allowed to lapse
through any neglect on the part of the
holder or other reason, and that formerly
in such event were open for relocation by
other miners, now, instead, revert to the
Government to be sold to the highest
bidder.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1900.
RATE FIXED FOR
FRUIT PACKING
Growers' Associations
Are Agreed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 6.â The Associated
Fruit Packers and the California Cured
Fruit Association have agreed upon terms
for handling the dried prune .crop of the
coming year, and a contract to this effect
will be signed to-morrow. This action as
sures the success of the Cured Fruit As
sociation and means the price of prune*
will become stable and growers will re
ceive a fair remuneration . for their
products.
The Associated .Packers agree to take
the entire prune crop of the State and
pack and handle the same at the prices
to be fixed by the growers' association.
The Santa Clara County Fruit Exchange,
which heretofore has handled the bulk of
the crop, and the six or seven co-operative
driers throughout the county are put on
the same footing as the commercial pack
ers and will receive their share of the
prune crop to sell. The placing of the co
operative dryers and the commercial pack
ra was the only question on which It\was
feared a split might result, but this was
adjusted amicably.
The packers are to be allowed $5 per
ton for receiving, handling, storing, grad
ing and packing the prunes in flrst-clnss
bags'. In addition to this will be added
the sale price paid by the consumer.
The following prices for the different
packs have been decided upon: Twenty
flve-pound boxes, $10 per ton; fifty-pound
boxes, $5 per ton; eighty-pound boxes, $5
per ton. Different packs costing moro or
less than these amounts will be adjusted
by the two associations.
The Cured Fruit Association will havo
Inspectors at the various packing-houses
to guard the interests of the producer and
association to see that goods are
packed according to the rules. The con
tract also specifies that all fruit shipped
must bear the association's brand, which
is to the effect that the goods are as rep
resented. Five per cent is allowed the
packers for- selling, and they are not
allowed to give more thaji one-half of this
to the Eastern broker.
This contract between the packers ana
the association is not to go Into effect un
less contracts covering 90 per cent of the
prune crop is secured from the growers,
unless by mutual consent a less percent
age would be acceptable. The conditions
agreed to refer to prunes only. In regard
to other varieties of dried deciduous fruits
and nuts the association will not attempt
to maintain the price unless 75 per cent
of the crop is controlled, but will sell
these products for Its members to thn
best possible advantage.
The growers are rapidly signing con
tracts with the association, and nearly
the entire prune crop will be signed. The
drying plants of the various co-operative
fruit associations will be used to cure the
fruit, and growers will have no further
to haul their fruit than in other years.

THE CALL AND THE SENATORSHIP.
THE successful -termination of the long struggle
to secure a United States Senator for Califor
nia is "a. subject for congratulation and good
feeling within and beyond party lines. The suffrage
of the people put upon the Republican party the se
lection,of a Senator. That duty carried with it a re
sponsibility to the whole State and an obligation to
that public opinion which sits in judgment upon par
ties and policies.
The Call bore its part in the fight' actuated by one
motive only. This paper at no time had any candi
date for the Senatorship. It sought only to secure
such a selection as would promote the self-respect of
every citizen and safeguard the interests of the State.
Our critics and our enemies, as well as our friends,
have never misunderstood our purposes.
We are anxious for the further success and con
tinued primacy of the Republican party, and are sen
sitive to the fame of California. Therefore we con
tested, step by step, all propositions, plans and cabals
formed for the purpose of unworthily bestowing the
Senatorship. This was done under the constant dan
ger of being accused of some form of self-seeking,
and sometimes this duty was discharged in the face of
other perils and in defiance of threats which the
strong use to appall the weak.
f We look back over the record with exactly the
! E3me sort of satisfaction that glows in enthusiastic
I expression throughout the State.
We hope that The Call is now better understood
than when the great fight began. We have opposed
r.o man whose election would have honored the party
and left unimpaired the magnificent strength it had
in 1898. Between t*e men worthy of the honor we
had at no time any choice. The selection of any one
of them, at any stage of the struggle, would have
commanded our support and indorsement. We have
conceived the function of a newspaper to be the de
feat, by all fair means, of any candidate who did* not
deserve the office and the honor, who had no equip
ment, mental or moral, for the great duties of Sena
tor, and whose election would hurt the State's pride
and bring the Republican party to present shame and
final defeat. That function The Call has discharged,
with conscience and courage. We have made no
effort to influence selection between gentlemen of
probity and fitness, but have stood between them as
a class and candidates who lacked either fitness or
probity, or both.
The record is made, and the Republican party and
the people of California now understand that The
Call fights no Republican who comes with clean
hands and purposes, and approved fitness, for the
public trust which he seeks. This paper is .not" a
broker in nominations, nor is it attorney in fact
for candidates. It is simply the implacable foe of that
immorality and ur.fitness which seeks sometimes to
artfully impose itself upon a successful party. As far
as the Southern Pacific Railroad is concerned, its
part in the contest was a mistake from which neither
the party nor the State will suffer, for both have
proved immune to its influence. The corporation
must bear alone the consequences of an act it had no
right reason for committing.. As a transportation
company the people are willing to be at peace with it.
Such business issues as arise between it and
its patrons the latter are willing to adjust in
a business way. When demagogues attack it,
and by threats arid appeals to prejudice en
deavor to force it into politics for defensive
purposes, the people are willing to keep it out of
politics by such a defeat of demagogy as they ad
ministered in 1898. Why not let it rest at that? Why
propagate a new spite in every unsatisfied political
ambition? Why seem to compel the best elements in
the State to mount guard continually to protect
themselves against some personal vagary of some
body connected with the railroad who, for reasons
that have no right relation to its real interests, tries
to impose unwortn and unfitness upon a place of
honor to transform it -into a place of shame? When
the Southern Pacific Company, within the limit of its
proper interests, needs defense we shall not scruple
to defend it. and when outside that limit it assumes to
do or to dictate where its presence is an affront, we
shall not scruple to fight it in the future as we have
given it battle in the past and have administered to
it the chastening admonition of defeat.
Having accomplished the task set for ourselves, in
the defeat of every candidate who did not deserve to
succeed, and whose success would have killed the
party and degraded the" State, The Call rests in the
company of the wise and upright for whom it has
spoken and wrought, ready to again clear the field of
the enemies of good government and leave it to the
victorious friends of that righteousness which" exalts
a party and gives it life in the confidence of the
people.
Complaint Against Fish-Dealers.

There is a movement on foot to divide Santa Clara

It is said that the managers of Corbett and Jeffries
Ere not in accord on many matters connected with

there is a chance that the fight will be on the square.
If they ever do, it will undoubtedly be a fake.

CALIFORNIA'S PERIL.
Tae Coast "Unites fo Defeat the New
Jamaica Treaty.
A meeting of Importance was held yes

State Board of Trade. J. A. Pllcher, who
for years past has held the position of
manager, was * compelled to retire from
office in order to â¢ accept the position of
assistant manager of the Southern Far
cine Company's exhibit at the Interna
tional Exposition at Paris, W. H. Mills
holding the first place. The exhibit com
prises every product of the Pacific Coast
and weighs several hundred tons. Over
7000 specimens of ores and mineral pro
ducts have been sent to Paris in the.col
lection, and the first work of Mr.*Filcher
will be to install and label the entire lot
In the English and French languages. He
will be joined in London by Mr. Mills.
In consequence of Mr. Filcher'B retire

Charles A. Â¦ Miller of Riverside, repre
senting the orange growers of Southern
California, urged the board to stand with

following telegram was sent to Hon.
James Wilson of the Department of Ag
riculture at Washington :
"The treaty imperils the life of the cit

A LESSON FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.
pZjOR many years Georgia claimed to be the em-
I pire State of the South. Her people, proud of
A the success achieved in the upbuilding of At
lanta and of several other cities of hardly less note,
fondly believed their State would continue to hold
the title undisputed. They have been startled to find
themselves outstripped in the matter of cotton manu
facturing "by ,South Carolina, and are busily engaged
in considering how it happened.
There are other folks than Georgians interested in
the subject. The development of the manufacturing
industry of South Carolina has been,. in fact, one of
the marvels of the last decade. The people are poor
they have no large cities, they have but little banking
capital, they have had no experience in factory work,
their advantages in the way of coal are less than those
of many other States, and they have nothing of su
periority in water power. Nevertheless they have
made such progress in the manufacture of cotton that
when certain large* additions now in process of con
struction are made to the existing mills South Caro
lina will rank second only to Massachusetts as a cot
ton manufacturing State.
A record of that kind is an interesting fact in the
history of American industry, and is well worth a
study. The Atlanta Constitution, for the' purpose of
disepvering the cause of South Carolina's progress,
sent a special correspondent to make a tour of the
State and carefully investigate the means by which
the work has been accomplished. He has made his
report to that paper, and it is as well worth reading
here as in Georgia.
South Carolina exempts cotton factories from tax
ation for a period of years, but the Constitution cor
respondent found that the exemption has. had little to
d 6 with the increase of her factories." The exemption
law was in force for many years, but no one took ad
vantage of it. Outside capitalists were indifferent to
it, and it can hardly be said to have brought a single
dollar to the manufacturing interests of the State.

Dinner.
One of tbe most delightful function* of
the season was the dinner given last even
ing by Miss Leah Shingleberger at the
elegant home of her aunt, Mrs. Nlebaum,
on Hyde street.
It was a red dinner and the color effects
were charmingly carried out in the dec
oration of the home and the table. Red
roses were used exclusively In beautifying
the board. . A feature of the dinner was
the exquisite music furnished by a string
orchestra during the service and when the
guests retired to the drawing-room for a
social hour before departure. Covers were
laid for eighteen. The guests were all
young people.

OUR HOME STUDY CIRCLE.
A GRATIFx ING evidence of popular satisfac
tion in the Home Study Circle of The Call-is
shown by the degree of interest taken in the
fpring course, which will begin on- Thursday, Feb
luary 15. The new series of studies will, we believe,
be found to be even more interesting than that which
has been running during the fall and winter. At any
rate the series is to include studies of subjects which
arc pertinent to the issues of the time, and will there
fore have a seasonable value in addition to their in-
The chief events of the year outside of the war in
South Africa are to be the Presidential election in the
United States and the universal exposition in Paris.
Relating to tbe first, the Home Study Circle will
have a series of papers on American political par
ties; while, for the benefit of those who design a
trip to Paris, or who for any other reason desire a
fair knowledge of the subject, there will be a course
of articles giving twenty lessons in French conversa
tion.
The other topics to be treated will be hardly less
interesting to the general public. Literary culture is
to well nigh universal in the United States that in al
most every home there will be one or more members
of the family who will find delight in the comprehen
sive course to be given in the papers on the Golden
Ages of Literature. The articles on Recent Scien
tific Discoveries will reveal a large amount of new
information on scientific subjects even to those who
have kept themselves fairly well posted on the extra
ordinary advance made by scientists in recent years.
Then the other topics, Photography for Amateurs
and Biographical Studies for Girls, will appeal to
thousands of readers outside of those for whom they
tre specially designed.
It wi'l be perceived that the spring course includes
Studies in American politics, the history of literature,
French conversation, scientific discoveries, pho
tography and a notable series of biographical articles
upon the lives and work of eminent women. There
ere six courses, one for each day of the week, ex
cluding Sunday, so that the same daily opportunities
for home study given during the fall and winter will
be carried through the spring term.
The contributors to the series are among the most
eminent educators and writers, of the country. The
course on American politics will be under the direc
tion of Jesse Macy, LL. D., professor of political
science of lowa College; Professor Benno Kirsch
baum, a distinguished French scholar and teacher,
trill prepare the instruction in French conversation:
the articles on scientific discoveries will be under the
direction of Professor William J. Hopkins of Drexel
Institute; George W. Gilson, editor of the Profes
sional Photographer, will have charge of the studies
in amateur photography; the biographical studies
â¢uill be under the supervision of Mrs. Charlotte
Erewster Jordan, author of "Royal Women of Euro
pean History"; and Edward Everett Hale of Boston,
Dr. Parrott of Princeton, Professor Palmer of Yale,
Professor More of Harvard, Professor Smith of the
University of Wisconsin, Miss Vida D. Scudder of
Wellesley, will contribute the papers on literature.
To each series of papers there will be many able
and brilliant contributors in addition to those named.
The whole spring course, in fact, will be one of
marked interest, and will add much to the value of
TWe Call as a family newspaper.

TRADE AND THE METRIC SYSTEM.
OWING to the intense competition of commerce
in these days and the closely matched powers
of the - principal competitors, any little advan
tage which one may have over another becomes a
matter of no slight importance. Consequently each
nation studies carefully the commercial system of the
other and takes note of every factor that affects the
world's market. Out of that condition of affairs has
come a revival of an agitation for the adoption of the
metric system of weights and measures in Great
Britain, for it appears that on the continent of Europe
the preference of the people for that system of
measurement constitutes a heavy handicap on the
sale of British goods in many of the Continental mar
kets.
The British Consul at Amsterdam is reported to
have recently directed the attention, of his country
men to some of the results of the handicap. It ap
pears the German manufacturers of iron and steel
have adopted a uniform scale of dimensions for cer
tain articles greatly in, demand, like steam boilers
and angle iron. These products arc carefully grad
uated in sizes for the trade, and the measurements all
conform to the metric standard. The latter already
prevails pretty generally on the continent of Europs.
Buyers there find it more convenient, consequently,
to patronize the German manufacturer than his
English rival, who adheres to the old system. For
bridge and other railway material, according to this
report, the preference is given to Germany; and in
the matter of pipes and tubes for water works "it is
absolutely certain that the Dutch market is com
pletely lost to Great Britain from the s?,me cause."
Incidentally it is added that a combination of Belgian
iron manufacturers has started works in China,
"where probably the Belgian system, and therefore
the metric, system, will be introduced."
Now that we have become large exporters of man
ufactured goods that information is of almost as
much interest to us as to the British. It seems in-,
evitable that the business world must come into some
sort of harmony in such matters. As all great com
mercial countries have found it of advantage to adopt
a common gold standard for their monetary systems,
so they will have to use a common system of weights
and measures. The many advantages the metric sys
tem has over that which prevails in the United States
and Great Britain renders it almost certain it will be
the system which will be accepted. Neither the
United States nor Great Britain, nor both combined,
can force their clumsy medieval method of weighing
and measuring upon the world in the face of the ex
cellent decimal system which the French have intro
duced and made popular throughout Europe. Sooner
or later we must come to it, and it would appear that
the sooner we do it the better.
THE gasoline schooner Nettle Low was capsized off
Bolinas In yesterday's northwester. Luckily the
captain, crew and passengers were saved, but the
vessel will probably be a total loss.
The Nettle Low left here at 8:45 o'clock yesterday
morning In charge of Captain T. G. Low. His crew con
sisted of his brother, J. A. Low, as engineer and Charles
Magruder. Mr. Bishop, a civil engineer connected with
the lighthouse department, and a Portuguese were passen
gers. There was a fair wind and no sea and no thought
was given of danger. When off Bollnas the wind fresh
ened considerably and was blowing nearly fifty miles an
hour at Point Reyes. A sudden puff of wind from the
shore caught the sail and keeled the vessel over and an
unusually large swell threw the schooner on her beam
ends. The passengers and crew took to the lifeboat and
rowed ashore, three miles distant. They reached land
safely and J. A- Low mounted a horse and rode to BoUr.aa
for assistance. Captain Low and.Magruder then roved
back to the vessel and anchored her and then waited for
a towboat. The anchor dragged, however, and the
schooner drifted to the shore. The brave skipper and Ms
assistant were carried out to sea, but were picked up by a
steam schooner bound north.
"When the towboat arrived Its services were not re
quired. She Is now lying on the north side of Bollnas
Point a total wreck. The Nettle Low was valued at J6OOO.
She carried butter from Point Reyes to San Francisco and
was well known on the bay.
The schooner Abbie also suffered during the north
wester. Her foresail was blown away and other damage
done. Shs cut back to port during the day.

adopted another method. They began to build small
factories with local capital, and as soon as these were
proven to be profitable Northern capitalists hastened
to take stock in them and to share in the profits. It
is said that "last year, when no benefits or induce
ments were offered or applied for, more capital was
invested than in the thirteen years when State, county
and city taxes were either refunded or remained un
collccted."
The Constitution says: "Local confidence, local
energy and local 'enterprise' attract the attention of
outside capitalists who have money to invest, and
this is the secret of the- tremendous advance which
South Carolina has made in the direction of cotton
manufacturing. Our correspondent says that there
is not a courthouse town in that State where from
$50,000 to $100,000 cannot be raised for investment in
a cotton mill. , This is all the incentive that outside
capital needs. When capitalists see comparatively
poor people ready to club their small savings together
and put it in any particular industry their conclusion
is that the risk must be exceedingly small, and so
they follow the example set."
There is a lesson in that for Californians as well as
for Georgians. We have no cotton, but we have
much raw material that now goes East to be manu
factured. It will never be manufactured here until
we begin the work. When we prove the industry to
be profitable, Eastern capital will. flow in. California
is far richer than South Carolina, but in how many
"courthouse towns" can we raise $100,000 to start a
factory for the manufacture of the raw products of the
locality?

PLANS FOR THE
ACQUISITION OF
ALL UTILITIES
Supervisors Urged to
Take Action.
REPORT OF CHIEF ENGINEER
? .
BOARD OF WORKS ASKS FOR AN
APPROPRIATION.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday re
ceived a communication from. City Engi
neer Grunsky in regard to a resolution
requesting the Board of Works to formu
late a plan under which the city may
gradually acquire its public utilities. The
report In part reads as follows:-
It is required by the charter that plans and
estimates be made of the cost of obtaining from
all of the available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good pure water. Taking tha
Investigations made by this municipality In
1876 as a guide It may be safely assumed that
ten independent sources of supply will have
to be examined. It will be necessary to investi
gate the quantity of water available for the
city's use. Its quality, storage facilities, con
duits for its delivery and Its distribution. The
minimum supply must be Investigated and it
is desirable that such Investigation should ex
tend over a number of seasons. The projects
will all Involve the crossing of tho bay with
a pipe line. It will be Impossible to reach final
conclusions within the year prescribed by the
charter, as little or no money can be raaiio
available to start actual work befora tho com
mencement of the next fiscal year.
It may be advisable to proceed by a process
of elimination and to determine on a basis
of a preliminary Investigation upon which
sources of supply final reports are most desired.
The projects to be examined and the order of
their Importance should be designated by the
Board of Supervisors, possibly after conference
with the Board of Works.
To further this end It would be advisable to
Issue a call for proposals to furnish water to
the city to request evidence as to the suffi
ciency of the supply and quality and the feasi
bility of Its delivery from the person or cor
poration offering the same. Similar steps
might also be taken In the matter of street
railroads so that the routes to be examined may
be designated. If this plan Is followed It Is
probable that a preliminary report can be made
within the time limit, provided that ample
means be placed at the disposal of the Engi
neer's office.
The following: estimate of the cost of
making the necessary surveys, plans and
reports is submitted, subject to correc
tion:
Water supply, on the assumption of six
projects to be examined 170.000
Gas works 7,600
Electric Hcht works, steam, water or
electric power works, telephone lines.. IS.OOO
Street rallrc-ads â¢ 7.600
Miscellaneous examinations, eto 7,500
Â¦Total $107,600
These sums, particularly In the case of
water investigations, cannot be all ex
pended to advantage before January 8,
1901. Any appropriation made for the pur
pose should be In the aggregate for the
examination of air public utilities rather
than in specific sums for each class. It
would be desirable to have about $12,000
set apart for. use in this connection dur
ing the present fiscal year, as it would
give deflnlteness to. the work remaining to
be done after July 1,1000. .

VALLEY ROAD ABOUT THROUGH.
Construction of the Line Rapidly-
Drawing Toward Completion.
Work on the Valley road Is going right
ahead, and If the good weather continues
the middle of April will see the first load
of freight and passengers landed in San
Francisco.
The road has now been laid four miles
this side of Cornwall, which leaves the
comparatively small gap of three miles
to be covered before the rails will extend
In one unbroken line from Stockton to the
great Franklin tunnel. The tunnel once
reached, the ties can be placed and the
rails laid through it as soon as the con
tractors desire, as the tunnel is In entire
readiness for their reception. It . will
probably be a week or ten days before
the rails are put In and trains running
through the big hole In the hill. The
twenty-one or twenty-two miles between
Franklin tunnel and Point Richmond are
all graded and only waiting for the plac
ing oT the track. This work will be
pushed ahead as quickly as construction
can be accompfished.
The heavy work of the Point Richmond
wharf is all finished and the men are now
employed on the sllp3 and aprons. This
will take them about a month or six
weeks, when everything will be in readi
ness for the reception of the Ocean Wave,
which will do the water transportation
until the completion of the new boat now
building at the Union Iron Works.
RULOFSON IS NOT
HALL'S ADOPTED SON
JXJTKJB BELCHER FINDS HE TTAfI
NO LEGAL CLAIM.
Executor of Decedent's Will Is Given
Judgment for the Property and
His Co9ts of Action.
Alfred C. Rulofson Is not the legally
adopted son of the late Captain Winslow
G. Hall. Neither is he entitled to tho ed
tate of the deceased. Such are the con
clusions of Judge Belcher, expressed In a
decision Hied yesterday. Mr. Rulofson
who Is a son of William H. Rulofson a
member of the late firm of Rulofson &
Bradley, filed suit shortly 'after the death
of Captain Hall to recover decedent's es
tate on the theory that he was the legally
adopted son of the deceased, and although
not mentioned In his will was in fact en
titled to the 'entire estate. George 10.
Billings, as executor of the decedent's
will, made answer to the demands of thÂ«
plaintiff and denied that the claimant had
ever been adopted by the deceased, ani
he prayed in his answer that the claims
of the plaintiff be denied and that defend
ant be given Judgment for his co3ts.
In concluding his opinion Judge B-lcher
said that upon the facts and circum
stances adduced In evidence the plaintiff
has not established the allegations of his
complaint, and the finding must be that
the plaintiff is not the adopted son of
Captain Winslow G. Hall; that Captain
Hall did not agree to make hi/n his heir,
or at his death, or at any time, by vill
or otherwise, to leave him his entire prop
erty, or any of It. or anything.
In conclusion the court orders that tho
plaintiff take nothing by his action an-1
that the defendant take his proper costs.

leading citizens to offer his name for the
place. Prominent merchants of this city
are outspoken in their indorsement of
Mr. Aigeltlnger for the place, because of
his being a practical business man and
one who was always ready to discuss

mRS. ERMALINH D'SYI/vTSIRA. who lived at
809 Wood street. Oakland, put an end to her ex
istence yesterday afternoon by jumping Into the
bay from the ferry boat Bay City. The. suicide
was the wife of a bÂ«arber named Manuel ,J. d'Sylvelra.
whose place of business Is on Clay street, near East, and
has been a chronic Invalid for years. It is believed that
suffering rendered her temporarily demented, as she tried
to commit suicide three months ago by taking carbolic
acid while partially out of her mind-'. .
The Bay City left the narrow gauge Oakland mote at
10 minutes after 8 o'clock and had Just passed Goat Isl
land, when a gentleman rushed Into the pilot-house and
Informed Captain Leale that two .ladies had seen a wo
man floating in the wake of the- eteamer. Captain Leale
stopped the steamer immediately, and the deckhands did
such quick work that a boat was' lowered as the steamer
came to a standstill. The boat was sent back for a dis
tance of a half mile, but the woman had ~ sunk and all
that was found was a plaid golf cape and a gray hat with
a black band and quills. On the starboard side of the
hurricane deck Captain Leale found a pair of dark tan
gloves and a purse of dark leather, the purse containing
SO cents, a ferry ticket, a scapular and a card. On one
side of the card. In script, was. the name "Mrs. Brmallne
d'Sylvelra," and on the other the address, "809 "Wood
street, Oakland. Cal."
A messenger was sent to that address, and finding no
body at home Informed Mrs. Dugrau, a near neighbor,
of what had happened. Mrs. ' Dugrau sent a drug clerk
named McCaffey to this city to Inform the husband.
D'Sylveira hastened home, and was coaxed by his friends
to go to one of their homes with his little boy Alfred, as
the. angulshr of the bereaved -husband was so great that
It was feared he would try to Join his wife in death. His
whereabouts was not divulged, but Mrs. Dugrau was per
fectly willing to state the circumstances surrounding the
suicide.
"Mrs. d'Sylveira has been an invalid for years," she
said, -'and tried to kill herself three months aero by taking
carbolic add. She took her "little boy to Oak Station to
day and sent him home with the word she was not going
to return. He told me, and I told the servant the hus
band hired to do the work some time ago. A search re
vealed that she had left a brief note to her husband that
her 6Ufterlng was more than she could bear, and she had
concluded to end It all. The two never had any domestic
trouble at all. Mrs. d'Sylvelra was 83 years old, and has
lived next door to me over 6ince she was married, at the
age of 19."

. "THE VICEROY."
Â»h g h t ?! a 7 3 and Poems substantially
through before attempting to deal with
them analytically or to make a compre
hensive plan for finding out all there id in
them. One will not nnd Shakespeare in
a single play, although in every play
there Is something of the genius of the
ma >!h .. c m y Ht cx P lo re the entire artistic
habitation which the poet built for h!m
selr before he can feel at home with th*
architect. It counts a great deal in Judg
in S of an artist to get into the atmosphere
of his mind, and one must read many
plays before he gets into the Shakespear
ean atmosphere. It is wise, therefore, to
read the plays from beginning to end, and
to get the first and obvious delight which
comes from such reading. The man who
Is bent on analysis, either literary or phil
osophical, is not in the way of receiving
the freshest Impact from the work with
which he is dealing. To get that one xaust
surrender himself completely to the Im
pression of the work; this is what the
Shakespearean student must do In the first
Instance. He must read the plays for the
sake of the playsâ for plot, story, human
interest, character drawing and the ex
haustless delight which comes from
Shakespeare's style.
It la often assumed that because Shake
speare is a classic he is therefore unin
teresting save to cultivated people, and
Â»Â£, chlldr en especially can make little
Â°" "lF\. or saln little from him. Nothing
could* be further from the truth. To any
man who has Imagination, no matter how
defective his training, or to any chlU
who has fancy. Shakespeare Is Interest-
Ing from the very start; for the story
telling element, of which he is a master.
is as pronounced and as effective as it
is In most of the great novels. To the
uncultivated and the cultivated alike this
Is the most immediate charm of Shake
speare and therefore the easiest way of
approaching him. To regard this elemen
tal Interest as something superficial an<i
not worthy the serious student Is to miss
Shakespeare's greatest qualityâ that is to
say, his literary quality; for It is the
prime business of literature not to in
struct us, but to stimulate and enlarge
our imaginations by interesting u<?. The
book which does not Interest after a fair
approach to it may contain valuable
thoughts or solid information, but can
not be literature: because Shakespeare's
plays are primarily literature and not
ethics, philosophy or philology; they are
extremely interesting 1 . One ought not to
be afraid to read Shakespeare for the
same reason that one reads Scott, Dick
ens or Thomas Hardy.
When such an acquaintance has been
formed and the student has become fa
miliar with the plays as a whole, perhaps
the next step Is to carry to its end the
process already begun; that Is to say. to
realize clearly in the Imagination the dra
matist himself. It Is sometimes said that
it is of no consequence what kind of a
man thfe author of a piece of work or
art is, so long as the work itself Is worth
while; but the fallacy of this principle is
shown by the fact that nobody ever acts
upon it. Everybody wants to know some
thing about the man whose pictures he is
seeing, whose architecture he Is studying
or whose written words he Is reading.
This is instinctive and it la universal and
therefore there is a good reason for it.
That reason is to be found in the fact
that a man's work, if it be really great
and Individual, is part of himself. It la
not a mere expression of his skill, some
thing which he has put together as a car
penter puts a house together, or a mason
lays a wall. It is something which he
has made out of himself. The special
quality of It Is not anything which he
gains from the world without or from
other artists; It is something which he
unconsciously Imparts to It from his own
nature. Thus there Is- in the work of
?Â«Â»ry great writer something distinctive
dr<3 -Individual; compounded x>t his- -tent.*
perament, his genius and bis character.
and that something Is the most original
and precious quality in his work. Every
thing else can be Imitated or reproduced
save that elusive quality of personality.
"When people are eager, therefore, to know
something about the writer of a book
they are on the right track, although
their curiosity is sometimes more eager
than Intelligent and their way of satisfy
ing it more energetic than delicate.
There was such a man as Shakespeare,
and there are plain records of him. When
the student has felt the charm of his
work and has learned something about
It he may well try to find the man; he
has already. If he is intelligent, found a
good deal about him in his work. It In
often said that as that work is dramatic,
and therefore impersonal, there la no rev
elation of the dramatist in It. This is a
great mistake. The dramatist is not to
be found in his work in the same aense
in which the lyrical poet is generally to
be found; the sentiments which are put
upon the lips of his actors must not be
put upon his own lips; he does not reveal
himself in the direct, definite and con
crete fashion- In which the makers of
some other kinds of literature often re
veal themselves. But no one can study
the plays of Shakespeare without becom
ing aware that they disclose a general
conception of life; that they are con
structed on the theory that certain results
follow certain causes. The keynote cf
those plays Is to be found In the word
character, as the keynote of the Gree*
plays was to be found in the word des
tiny. Shakespeare believed profoundly Jn
the moral order of the world. He be
lieved also In social and political order;
he believed In order In the Individual life.
In the balance of qualities. In the subor
dination of the lower to the higher. It Is
easy to see that he was not a cynic; that
he had not an Impure mind, although the
coarseness of his time Is sometimes re
flected in his work; that he was not a
morbid man. In a word. It is not dlfflcit't
to find the spiritual man behind the work.
The order in which the plays were en
tered at the stationer's Is known. It is
therefore possible to trace the growth of
his mind. Many facts about his persona!
life are known. In spite of statements
to the contrary. Stratford Is full cf
Shakespearean associations. All this ma
terial can be found In a few good dooks
like Mr. Lee's "Life of Shakespeare. "
Professor Barrett Wendell's "William
Shakespeare." Professor Dowden's "Mind
nnd Art of Shakespeare" and Georj?
Brandes' "William Shakespeare: A Crit
ical StUdy." .en.%.
Having gotten the image of Shakespeare
in one's mind, the student will do well to
take up the plays and study them moro
critically. With the aid of a good tex*.
good notes and Introductions he ought to
understand the background of each play:
that is to say. the sources from whicli !t
was derived, the time In Shakespeare's*
life In which it was written and any pe
culiar circumstances attending either its
creation or its production.
This knowledge is not difficult of ac
cess. It Is idle for the roan who does not
intend to be a Shakesperean scholar to at
tempt to master all the Shakespearean
literature. The general student need 3 to
put himself In possession of such facts ns
will enable him to group the plays In the
order of their production with referenca
to the growth of Shakespeare's mind, to
understand the sources from which the
plots or parts of the plays were d-erived
and" the immediate historical background.
When he has done this. In addition to thÂ«s
other things which have been enumerate-1,
he Is In a position to read and enjoy the.
plays to the full. From this point he may
go rÂ»i Indefinitely to study the philosophy
of life behind the -plays, which he may
discover for himself or which he may takn
from a half-dozen authorities, among
them Denton Snider, whose very Â«uc
gestlve commentaries need not bÂ« wholly
accepted In order to be thoroughly en-
Joyed. After all. the best way to kno*
Shakespeare Is to possess a good edition
In small volumes, such an edition, for In
stance, as the Temple Shakespeare; to
carry a volume In- one's pocket; to fit
down one's newspaper reading and to de
vote one's time, as one travels In street
cars, railway trains and ferries, to the
reading of Shakespeare.

XIIL HOW TO STUDY SHAKE
SPEARE.
Ho would be a bold man rather than a
wise one who should attempt to lay down
a system of rules for the study of Shake
speare which should be equally applica
ble to persons of all conditions of intelli
gence, previous preparation and taste.
There are almost as many ways of study-
Ing as there are students; and one of the
most important results of education is
not to secure a certain amount of infor
mation or training, but to learn how to
study. The wise advlseV will not venture
in such a matter beyond a few hints,
which may be taken as suggestions rather
than as directions.
It is a matter of prime importance to
become Interested in the subject which
one is to study. When one has become
interested he may know that the mind
has taken hold, and after that the process
of perception, assimilation and digestion
goes on rapidly and almost automatically.
In the study of Shakespeare it Is best to
begin by making the poet's acquaintance
in the most direct and familiar fashion.
It is impossible to begin to study a man
Intelligently until you are fairly well ac
quainted with hfm. To study his environ
ment before you have seen him or to try
to make a chart of his characteristics be
fore he has revealed himself to you In fa
miliar intercourse Is to begin at the wrong
end and waste your time. Great works of
art are not begun by rule, nor are they
carried on by precept, although both ru'.es
and precepts may be derived from a study
of their methods after they are com
pleted. Great works of art are not mas
tered and their spiritual and artistic con
tent Is not assimilated by following ab
stract methods, although after one has
learned them by heart he may be able to
retrace and mark out the processes by
which they have been produced. A great
many useful books are written In the?e
days about other books, but these aids,
guides and commentaries ought not to be
used at the start; what Is needed then is
direct contact with the subject. The stu
dent who is going to study Shakespeare
would better begin by getting on easy
terms .with him; that Is to say, by read-
INSANE SOLDIER ESCAPES
FROM PRESIDIO HOSPITAL
ELUDED HIS GUARD WHILE BE
ING TAKEN TO BREAKFAST.

eral of Mrs. Texton, "Wife of O
Troop's First Sergeant.
John Quinn, a private in Company E of
the Eighteenth Infantry and an Insane
patient In the general hospital at the Pre
sidio, escaped from his guard yesterday
morning and has not since been captured.
Qulnn came in on the Senator. He was
violent at times and so was put under
strict surveillance, a sentry being detailed
to follow him. about whenever he left his
quarters. Yesterday morning he was
taken down to breakfast In the big dln
ing-rc;gi>_ t Â« r*d In eorae-way he elude-} thÂ«
vigilance ! of hli guard and got clean
away. All yesterday men of the hospital
corps were out looking for him, but up to
late last night they had heard nothing of
him.
Qulnn is a man about 80 years of age.
When he got away he was dressed i>i
khaki trousers and a blue shirt, without
a blouse. He is clean shaven and has the
look of an Insane man in his face. It in
not considered that he is dangerous, but
he is likely to give some one a scare be
fore he is again lodged In the hospital.
His guard has gone the way of all defect
ing sentries. He has been put under ar
rest pending trial on a charge of allowing
a person in his care, similar to a prisonei ,
to escape. *
The wife of First Sergeant Texton of
Troop G of the Sixth Cavalry, who died
suddenly at the Presidio on Sunday last
of heart disease, was burled In the Na
tional Cemetery yesterday by the Order
of the Eastern Star, of which she was a
past grand matron.
Bernard McDonogh, a private of Com
pany F of the Third Infantry, died at the
general hospital yesterday. He came c\er
from the Islands on the transport Senator.
The bodies of the men brought nonw
from Manila are being shipped East very
rapidly, but they are coming In nearly as
rapidly, and so the storehouses are kept
full. The department headquarters has
had to refuse a great many applications
for bodies because they are not made by
authorized persons. The military law
takes notice of no one who is not a rela
tive or some one authorized by a relative
to arrange for the disposal of the body,
so all who are not entitled to considera
tion are being refused. Colonel Long, un
der wbom is the work of shipping the bod
ies to their proper destinations, competing
too that frequently orders regarding the
disposal of a body will come from three
or four of the same family, and they are
not always In harmony. In such cades It
takes time and a great deal of trouble to
arrive at a knowledge of Just what the
relatives wish. There has been no serious
hitch so far, however, and what delays
have occurred are chargeable more to the
relatives than to the officials in charge of
the dead.

7e\fcÂ» York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 6.â The stock market re
tained its general characteristics to-day of
strength and breadth. A large outside interest ,
was manifest and the professional operators
who bought at the lower le,vel were busy in
bidding up the prices of their holdings and
in feeding the new demand to take their
profits; but while selling stocks from the one
hand to realize on the rise they were taking
on new holding* of different stocks with the
other. Apparently the confidence that stocks
which have not yet shared In the advance
could be induced to move upward was unlm
paired and the holdings of the large financial ,
Interests which have taken hold of the market
were broadened and extended. The duration
of this kind of upward movement does not '
always depend Ftrictly on the continuance of
the public demand for stocks. There Is a con
etanl process of unloading by compact and
well organized financial Interests into the
hands of scattered and unskilled speculators
who have not the same exi*?rience and adroit
ness In protecting their holdings, ncrr the same
resources for maintaining them. The progress
of a bull movement almost inevitably results
in the transfer of holdings from strong to
weak hands and leaves the market vulnerable
to attack by bear operators who are able to
force Belling by offering down prices and un
covering margins. Even to-day attempts by
bear operators were in evidence to force de
clines, but the general demand for stocks con
tinued so good and the large holdings are still
Jn puch strong hands that the market resisted
bear assaults and presented a hard and un
yielding surface, even at points where realiz
ing was going on. Yesterday's strength In
National Steel gave way to realizing to-day
and the metal group of stocks was without
any conspicuous leadership. Norfolk and
Western was also sold to take profits all day
after an opening rise of a point, but refused
to yield below last night's level. Tennessee
Coal was forced down at one time 3% points.
Bears centered their attack on Sugar and had
that *tock down at one time to 1%4- Rumors
that the refineries were to shut down and over
prfiduction to be worked off at a loss figured
in the manipulation. But in the meantime
en aggressive buying movement developed In
the trunk lines, led by Pennsylvania, the
ooalens. led by Reading first preferred, on the
decision to pay a dividend and In the grangers
and westerns, led by St. Paul and Atchlson,
both common and preferred. The Baltimore
and Ohio also after a pause of a day to di
pest profit-taking renewed the advance. The
progress toward extension of holdings by the
(rreat railroad systems of leaser and competing
ryptems had much to do with the strength of
Pennsylvania and other lines supposed to be
In process of absorption. The coming advance
in the tidewater freight rates on bituminous
coal was also an element. In the outside mar
ket there was an advance of over 3 points to
245 In the price of Standard Oil on the declara
tion of a dividend of 20 per cent for the quar
terly period. Last year's dividends were 6,
12. I and 10 per cent respectively for the four
Quarters. There wan also activity l:i the
Amalgamated copper shares. The closing of
the n;a.rket was active and strong at about
the toj>.

London Markets.
NEW YORK, Feb. 6.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
African mines opened blazing here to-day,
the market being full of rumors that Lady
smith had been relieved and that 7000 Boers,
had been captured at Colesberg. The- other
departments participated In the rise though
business was small. There was no confirma
tion of any of the rumors and prices fell away
after 2 o'clock. Consols, which were 101 H.
closed at 101. Americans maintained their
strength. The continent and arbitrage houses
bought freely though there was hardly any
London account and New York support made
the close at top prices. The chief feature was
Norfolk and Western, on the theory that that
road would be amalgamated with the Balti
more and Ohio or the Pennsylvania. Paris
was still buying Tintos and Anacondas and
higher prices for the latter were confidently
predicted.
The Bank of England bought Â£212.000 of gold
In German coin and received Â£15,000 from
Germany. For South Africa Â£21.000 was taken.
The Influence was not expected. It Is not
thought that the buying will reduce the buy
ing price of German coin to-morrow. Money
and bills were idle at unchanged rates. The
Bank of the Netherlands reduced its minimum
discount rate from 4 to 3Vi per cejit. Paris
cheque was 21.15V4; Berlin. 20.49.

U '" a! 52 2.8 9:54 Â».Â« 4:32 0.1 11:06 S-0"Coffee used to give me a sick head-
ache occasionally, and the coffee habit
was so fixed that if I quit it for a day, a
headache would follow. I was thus be-
tween two fires, and it was headache and
sickness cither way.
"Finally I was pushed to a point
where I concluded to' give up coffee al-
together and try Postum Cereal Food
Coffee. For a morning or two I stood
the headache caused by a lack of my ac-
customed drug, but in three days I be-
gan to get on the right road, and since
that time I have been getting better and
stronger steadily.
Â¦ "One can hardly realize the pleasure
it is to feel well again, and yet I have
my delicious morning cup of Postum
regularly, which tastes like coffee, looks
like coffee, and yet gives me true
ftrength and health. Mrs. B , 60S
Croton Sq., Syracuse, N. V. t says: 'Pos-
tum Food Coffee was recommended to
me for rheumatism by the physician.
He will not allow the use of common
coffee, hut says that Postum is strength-
ening and beneficial to a system under
acute rheumatic suffering. 1 find it most
excellent.'
"Professor Duvoll of the Syracuse
Universit}' says: 'I cannot drink coffee;
use Postum Food Coffee, which has a
strengthening influence for any one do-
ing brain and nerve work.' Mr. Wil-
liams says: 'Coffee produces dizziness,
dullness and nausea, with me. I use. and
much prefer. Postum Food Coffee,
which gives strength and a true healthy
condition.' Please do not use my name
in pub-lie. Respectfully, Mrs. E. W. L.,

Phillips and His Wife.
A beautiful story is told of "Wendell
Phillips, the famous American orator. Il
lustrating his lover-like devotion to his
invalid wife, relates the New York Mail
and Express. At the close of a. lecture
engagement In a neighboring town his
friends entreated him not to return to
Boston.
It was a fearful cold night, and the last
train had gone, so he would have to re
turn In a carriage. "You will have twelve
miles of rough riding before you get
home," they said.
"But at the other end." he replied. "1
shall find Anno Phillips."

NARROW ESCAPE FROM
DEATH BY SUFFOCATION
, ALAMEDA, Feb. 6.â Several persons in
the residence of George *W. Scott, 1723
Central avenue, were overcome by smoke
during a fire there at an early hour this
morning and narrowly escaped death.
Mrs. H. F. Whitman and Miss Maud Scott
were carried from the burning structure
in an unconscious condition by the fire
men, and it took a considerable time to
resuscitate them.
The nre originated from a defective
furnace in the basement and was unaer
considerable headway when the depart
ment arrived. Chief Krauth and several
of his men made several ineffectual at
tempts to enter the house before they
were successful. The smoke was den>e
and drove them from the place repeat
edly. A ladder was finally placed against
an attic window and the inmates were
rescued by means of it. Exit had been
cut off in other quarters.
The flames were confined to the lower
portion of the structure, but considerable
damage was done by water and the loss
will reach several thousand dollars.
Besides the two women who were car
ried from the house in an unconscious
condition, the hcuse contained H. F. Whit
man, four children and two servantts.
They were all considerably overcome by
the smoke but managed to climb down
the ladder unaided. --.'â¢'
Mr. and Mrs. Scott are at present In
New York City on a visit.

and Mrs. S. T. Alexander, and
John Waterhouse of Honolulu took
place this evening at 8 o'clock at the
handsome residence of the bride's pa

performed by the Rev. Charles R.

The Alexander home was most
beautifully decorated for the event.

and there. The reception room was
entirely In green, smilax being used.

impressive. The bride, who Is petite

and carried lilies of the valley. Her
maid of honor, Miss Harriett Kitt
redge, wore an elegant gown of white
with an overdress of point d'esprit.
She carried white blossoms. The
bridesmaids were Miss Belle Dickie,
a cousin, and the Misses Carmen
Moore and Emma Grimwood. They
were dressed alike in white liberty
silk. Wallace Alexander, the bride's
brother, was best man. The recep
tion that followed the ceremony was
attended by several hundred guests,
including some of the most prominent
society people on both sides of the
bay.
The bride is a member of Oakland's
younger set, and has been very prom
inent at the different cotillons and
other smart affairs held this season.
She is extremely popular because of
her genial and sweet disposition. Mr.
Waterhouse is prominent in the isl
ands, where the Alexanders have ex
tensive interests and where they
spend a part of each year. The two
families have been intimately ac
quainted for years and the union Is
one that Is particularly pleasing. The
young couple were the recipients of
many elegant gifts, chief among
which was the deed of an elegant
home in Honolulu, a present from the
bride's father.
DEVISED ALL TO
HER WHO WAS A
MOTHER TO HIM
KNOCKED FROM
A BOX CAR AND
TORN IN SHREDS
W. F. Montres In
stantly Killed.
s Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 6.
W. F. Montrefe, a switchman, was
knocked from the top of a boxcar by a
smokestack which projected over the
track from the trainshed at the Alameda
mole this morning. He was instantly
killed. Four wheels of a car passed over
his body, mangling it In a horrible man
ner.
The accident occurred Just after 4
o'clock. Montres was standing on top of
the car, which was being shunted by a
yard engine, and he failed to see the ob
struction. When struck .the switchman
fell between the cars and across the
track. Some of the wheels passed over
the body, almost cutting it in two. An
other wheel passed over the head of the
unfortunate man, crushing it to a pulp.
The body was taken to the Morgue and
Coroner Mehrmann will hold an Inquest.
The deceased was a yard switchman and
had been In the employ of the railroad
company for several years. He was con
sidered a careful and responsible man.
Montres was about 28 years of age and
unmarried. He resided at the Bay View
House near the mole, and has parents
living at Boulder Creek, Santa Cruz
County. Â¦
Mrs. Lanktree Files
W. P. Jones.W ill.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 6.
Because she had cared for and guarded
over him as a loving mother for more than
twenty-one years William P. Jones, the
aged capitalist and bachelor, who died in
Alameda last week, left his entire estate
to Mrs. Susan Lanktree.
Mr. Jones was 78 years old at the time
of his death, January 29 last. His will,
executed December 19, 5899, was filed for
probate this afternoon, and Mrs. Susan
Lanktree, who is named as sole devisee
and also executrix without bonds, has ap
plied, for letters of administration. The
instrument is very brief. It simply recites
that "I devise and bequeath all my es
tate, real, personal or mixed, wheresoever
situated, including all property of which
I may die seized, possessed or In any way
entitled to or interested In, to my friend,
Susan Lanktree. now residing at my home
in Alameda." The clause making her ex
ecutrix follows.
Mrs, Lanktree's petition for letters re
cites that the estate is valued at about
J30.500, being $12,500 of real estate In Ala
meda and Oakland and $18,300 of personal
property.
Jones came to California across the
plains in 1849. He never married, and so
far as can be learned left no relatives or
heirs at law.. For over twenty-one years
Mrs. Lanktree had guarded over him
with almost the same tenderness as she
exerted over her son. J. B. Lanktree.
LAW'S METHODS
CRITICIZED BY
A LADY LAWYER
Clara Foltz Creates a
Scene in Court.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway. Feb. 6.
"Do you expect the women of this Stat*
to take the law in their own hands, your
Honor? This man Freeman ought to bo
sent to jail!"
After addressing these stinging worrla
to Superior Judge Hall in open court to
day, Clara Foltz, the woman . attorney,
representing Mrs. Sarah Freeman, Â»ho
had her husband cited for contempt in
refusing to pay alimony, rushed from lli-j
courtroom, followed by her fair client an I
several lady friends, and a3 she hurried
through the corridor she waa heard to
murmur something about "a moral cow
ard, that's all."
Judge Hall had just dismissed the cita
tion directing Thomas B. Freeman to ex
plain why he should not be punished for
â¢having failed to pay his divorced vife
*534 back alimony"; why he had. as his ex
wife alleged in her petition, â¢'defle.l the
authority of the courts" and "sneered at
the majesty of the law."
On twenty previous occasions Freeman
had been cited for similar tardiness- in
obej-lng the court's decree. On each oc
casion he had the sum total due Increase
J2O. And each time Freeman had escaped
without a touch, claiming that he had
been haled to court so frequently that
he could not discover an opportunity to
earn enough to meet the demands of the
law. On the witness stand Freeman de
nied that he defied the court's authority
or sneered at the majestic law. "I. have
no reason for so doing." he said. "The
courts have always treated me fairly."
"And do you think," queried Mrs. Foltz.
plaintiff's attorney, "that because the
court has stood by you twenty tlm^s thÂ»
court ought to make it twenty-one?"
Judge Hall mildly reproved the fairer
Bexed advocate and prevented Freeman's
reply by admonishing her that "your re
marks are very offensive to this court ."*
and Mrs. Foltz apologized profusely,
while his Honor dismissed the citation.
Judge Hall gave the plaintiff but one
consolation. W. B. Woodward, Freeman's
employer, had testified that the defend
ant had worked only part of the time
since the last citation and had not eamc<l
enough to pay the alimony, and Judge
Hall remarked that If ever Freeman do? 3
earn or accumulate enough he can be
brought Into court and be made to pay.
An effort on the part of Mrs. Foltz to
have the citation go over for a month
was knocked early in the game.
SCHOOLMARMS
MUST CEASE
USING SLANG
Trustees Condemn
Nicknames.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Feb. 6.
Teachers who persist in calling pupils
by nicknames hereafter are liable to of
ficial decapitation. Tne practice has been
prohibited by an edict of the Board of
Education. * The slang of the street must
be expurgated from the pedagogic vocab
ulary, and nothing but the purest of
Queen's English Is to be hereafter toler
uted. Curbstone language Is alleged to
have been used by demure and pretty
young schoolma'ams in addressing chil
dren of unruly disposition and, further
more, It is asserted that some of the ob
streperous kids were dubbed with derisive
noms de plume.
The matter was brought before the
Board of Education last night. All the
members were a unit in declaring that
hereafter a teacher guilty of such an act
shall be liable to a peremptory dismissal
from service. The particular case which
brought the practice up for attention was
one wherein a boy was contemptuously
called "Tougny" by an irate teacher.
Superintendent McClymonds was told to
make an investigation, and should he find
that the use of nicknames by teachers la
prevalent it will be stopped, even though
the official guillotine has to be brought
into requisition.
"Here, Swipsey, come up here and put
on the duncecap" will no longer be ut
tered by an angry young miss In address
ing a pupil.
"Shorty, "Fatty." "Red." "Blinky,"
"The Kid," "Three-Fingered Jack."
"Rain-In-the-Face." "The Spider," "Run
away Bill." "Petey." "Brlcktop." "Gib
lets." "Nibs" and the rest of the crowd
of 10-year-olds with eimila/ descriptive
appellations have been tabooed. Teachers
have been officially notified arid ordered
to erase them from the books of choice
names of pet pupils.
"John Henry," "James Augustus," "Al
fonso," "Clarence" or whatever other
name a budding genius may have hap
pened to have- been cumbered with at the
baptismal font must now be used, t when
the boys are addressed by their Instruc
tors. Opprobrious phrases are also ta
booed.
"I think that the cases where teachers
use nicknames or slang In reproaching a
pupil are isolated ones," said Assistant
Superintendent of Schools R. B. S. York.
"Even if that Is the case, however, it
must be stopped altogether. Superintend
ent McClymonds has started in to make
a thorough investigation, and if any of
the teachers are. found guilty of such
conduct tney will be suspended or ex
pelled from duty. Children are sensitive,
and when contemptuously referred to by
their instructors they feel it keenly, and
it makes them sullen and rebellious.
Kindness, firmness and politeness are the
three best things to govern pupils with
in a school. If a child persists in being
refractory after being handled in that
manner, the case should be referred to
the Superintendent and he will dispose
of it."
Many of the teachers are shocked to
learn that charges of such indecorous be
havior have been made against some of
their number. They all assert most posi
tively that such cases are rare, If they
exist at all.
SHE WILL WED
HIM EVEN IN
HIS OWN HOME
Miss Darneal True to
Alan Bowen.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Feb. 6.
Alan Bowen and his approaching wed
ding to Miss Susie Darneal of Alameda
have caused a rupture in the Darneal
household to such an extent that the ap
proaching wedding has been announced
for the home of the groom, and there ia
consternation where this fact is known.
The groom is giving his opinion of his
mother-in-law-elect before marriage and
the mother-in-law-elect has a few words
to say. about the new addition to the
household, which words are supplemented
by some from the father. Meanwhile Miss
Darneal says tnat she is going to marry
Mr. Bowen, even if she has to do It at the
home of his parents.
Alan Bowen is the son of Charles G.
Bowen of the firm of Wetmore, Bowen &
Co., the San Francisco wine merchants.
Miss Susie Darneal is the- daughter of
Harvey Darneal, one of the court report
ers of this county. The parents of the
young lady knew nothing about the ap
proaching wedding until it was announced
and they do not hesitate to oppose it
openly.
"If my daughter leaves her parents for
this man she leaves our house forever,"
said Mr. Darneal to-day. "Of course she
is of age and can do as she pleases, but
it will not be with our consent. She can
not be married in our home and none of
our family will be present. We have only
one cause of objection to this young man
â we do not think he is a proper one for
our daughter to marry. We will offer no
objection, but we will not assist in the
wedding."
This, is what Mr. Bowen says in reply:
"The statement that I have been denied
the privilege of visiting Mls3 Darneal at
her home is not quite correct. I call there
frequently and am received as courteously
as I could expect in view of the fact that
her parents object to mo as a son-in-law.
The opposition comes principally from
Mrs. Darneal. She has brought every
possible argument to bear against our
marriage. She has not succeeded in her
efforts, however, and the ceremony will
take place as planned. I consider myself
quite the equal of Mrs. Darneal so far as
lineage goes, for two of my ancestors
fought in the Revolutionary War. I am
a Junior member of the firm of Wetmore.
Bowen & Co. of San Francisco. The fact
that the firm deals in liquors is one of the
arguments used against me."
Miss Darneal is true to her accepted
lover and she declares her intention of
marrying him. despite her parents.
"Our wedding day has been set and
that's all there is to it." said Miss Dar
neal. "I have known Mr. Bowen for a
long time and have learned to regard him
highly. The antagonism of my parents to
our approaching marriage is without good
reason. At present we are agreed that
the marriage shall take place on the 19th
at Mr. Bowen's home. If my parents re
lenj.. then we will be married at my own
home. There will be nothing elaborate
about the affair.

WHEELER IS NOT
GOING EAST FOR
NEW MATERIAL
At Least Not on This
Little Trip.
BERKELEY. Feb. 6.â President Benja
min Ide Wheeler* of the University of Cal
ifornia left for the East last night, to be
gene for several weeks. His mission is
I not. he says, that of seeking new material
| for the university, but one of obligation.
While a professor at Cornell University
he was engaged to give a series of five
lectun-s on "Greek Life" to the students
of the university at Richmond, Va. In
addition he will speak at the dedicatory
exercises of the Perkins Men's building
at Colorado Springs, at the Washington's
birthday celebration of JohnsllopkinsUni
versity, before the Civic League of Chi
cago and at the national convention of
Superintendents of Education.
But while the president will not admit
to more than a lecturing tour upon this
trip he says that he is going East again
and will then fish out some new material
for the university faculty. In view of thlt
admission a great deal of wonder Is being
expressed in Berkeley as to whether
President Wheeler will not keep a quiet
lookout on this trip for men who might
wain to help ljuild the greater University
of California. There have been many ru
mors as to what President Wheeler in
tended to do with his staff/and it is of
interest to know what the new president
thinks. Before leaving for the East he
made this statement:
"So, I am not going East to get new
material for the University of California,
I will make a special trip a little later for
that purpose. The time is not ripe for any
changes if there be any intention of mak
ing changes. My trip will be well taken
up with official visits and lectures in vari
ous States. If the time were opportune
and everything else agreeable I could not
possibly do Justice to such a matter in the
limited time at my disposal.
"i do not know of any changes in the
faculty that are contemplated. The uni
versity is growing and changes and addi
tions must necessarily be made. At pres
ent, however, nothing can be done be
cause of the lack of funds. That is the
one thing which will prevent the Univer
sity of California from going to the front.
As soon as we can get appropriations
from the State or money from private
sources, then the college will be put on a
new footing.
"Since I came here I have made a care
ful etudy of the needs of the university
aa regards the chairs and equipment. The
equipment in some departments needs ad
ditions and I trust will be straightened
out before another year. For the past few
weeks I have visited the recitations that
I might be familiar with every professor
and instructor and every department. If
we see our way clear a little later in the
year I will go East again and devote my
entire time to getting men who will fit the
positions they are chosen for in the best
possible manner. We want the best men
we can secure, and when we have that
the future of the university is assured.
If the State will do its part there need be
no fear for the future of the University
of California."
DISLIKES THE
WAY THE CLERK
KEEPS BOOKS
Expert Reports Many
Discrepancies.
?
ALAMEDA. Feb. Â«.â The clock In the
Council chamber was ret hack twenty
minutes last nicht In order th.at the report
of the expert who had been engaged on
the city's books could be legally received
by the Hoard of Trustees. On two occa
sions the animated discussion over the re
port between Trustee Mackie and City
Clerk Ivamborn came near extending Into
Tuesday's precincts, but each time the
hands of the clock were caught as they
were giving the expiring tick before 12
iind turr.ed back to 11:50 p. m.
l>. E. Dyer is the expert whose report
oauÂ«Â«d the City Trustees to hold a mid
night session. lie was api>ointÂ«l live
months ago to check up and pot the city's
books in shape for the satisfaction of the
Finance Committee. Trustee Mackie,
chairman, read the report, and between
him and the Clerk sarcastic words and
lkÂ»ree looks were exchanged. The Cierk
did not enter any denial of the allegations
madf against him. He will reserve his
trumdums for the ppecial investigation
which will be called.
A list of some 300 alleged discrepancies
between warrants and demajids accora
par.iM the. report. It was shown that
duplicate warrants were drawn for the
same demand, that amounts on demands
and warrants do not correspond and that
alterations have been made in demands.
The report reads as follows:
Board of Trusteesâ Gentlemen: I have foun<l
that the City Cork's office has b"Â«>n conducted
In a very careless mannf-r. A great many dls
orepanclf?* have occurred between warrants and
demand*. In a number of cases duplicate and
triplicate warrants have been Issued for the
name <3etÃand.
Ttie book of demands and warrants is writ
ten up from the warrants, while the charter
F*ys that thÂ» entries shall be made from the
demands. Some of the books have not been
written up nor balanced for many months.
In a number of cases the. demands have been
altered, uid the same alterations have not
beÂ«n made in the books of the City Clerk.
Many demands have net been sworn to by
creditors.
It has oft^n occurrÂ«?d that the number of
the demand does not correspond with the num
ber of the warrant, and hundreds of demands
have not been numbered. The books of this
uffice have not bÂ«en balanced with the Treas
urer's monthly reports, and no efforts have
been made to find differences between these
offices when they have occurred.
The amount overpaid on warrants was
stated by Trustee Mackie to be about $200.
Some of this money has been paid back
into the city treasury- The remaining
sums will be collected by the City Attor
ney.

OUTBREAK OF
HIGHBINDER
WAR AT HAND
Police Taking Many
CHINESE SIX COMPANIES ACT
RIGID ENFORCEMENT OF THE
LAW BY THE ACTING CHIEF.
The police are preparing for another
outbreak of the highbinder war in China
town. Several things have transpired
within the last few days which have given
rise to the conclusion that murder is agaJn
on the tapis and that the truce had sim
ply been declared for the purpose of hood
winking the police into granting unlimited
privileges to the Mongolians during their
new year celebration. So serious have
matters trended during the past few days
that a meeting of the Chinese Six Com
panies was held last night to raise money
with which to compensate the Hop Sing
tong for the lives they lost during the
past portion of the war and to offer an
inducement to them to keep the peace.
Detective McMahon stated last night
that a murder might be expected on any
day. He says that the undercurrent of
fear among the Chinese, which charac
terized the first part of the struggle, has
again manifested itself, and the highbind
ers have stowed themselves away, in
places of seclusion, from which they
emerged to participate in the New Year
festivities. The police were obliged to
liberate a highbinder recently whose iden
tity as a murderer had been established,
because Chinese witnesses on whose testi
mony they relied had been seized with the
war fever arid escaped.
Last night the members of the Chinese
Six Companies held a meeting at their
headquarters for the purpose of devising
means by which to ward off the trouble
which seems Imminent. It will be remem
bered that no money .was offered to the
worsted tong for lives that had been sac
rificed from its ranks, and this fact alone
made all "who are acquainted with Chinese
affairs look with suspicion on the peace
compact. The Six Companies took the
matter of the compact under advisement
and sought to make it binding by having
a clause offering an amount of money for
the lives lost inserted in it. Representa
tives of the Hop Sing tong who were
present winked their eyes and refused to
accept any other declaration than that
already signed by them. The elimination
of a monetary consideration is said to be
sufficient excuse for a renewal of hostili
ties, with revenge as an object.
Acting Chief Biggy recognizes the se
rious situation and has taken precautions
which have never been taken before. As
a result Chinatown is more firmly under
police control than at any time in its past
history. Everything that contributes to
the highbinders' coffers has been sup
pressed, and this method iÂ« rtgarded as
the only one instrumental in rooting out
bold crime. All the gambling- houses in
that section of the city have been closed
and the paid assassins have been hounded
from their holes. Police constantly patrcl
the streets for the purpose of enforcing
a strict observance of the laws, and only
competent officers have been chosen for
such duty. -

Thomas Returns.
President Newhall upon convening the
Police Commissioners last night an
nounced that owing to the absence of
Commissioner Thomas the board had de
cided to take no action regarding the elec
tion of Chief of Police, preferring to wait
until all the Commissioners could be pres
ent.
The remaining three hours of the ses
sion were mostly. taken up with the con
federation of applications for liquor li
censes. Four hundred and forty-six appli
cations, reported upon favorably by the
nergeants and patrolmen to whom they
had been referred for investigation, were
gTanted. Applications rejected at the lest
meeting by reason of the fact that ap
plicants had rooms connected with their
saloon* with partitions higher than al
lowed by the ordinance were reconsidered
and granted upon the understanding. that
applicants would reconstruct these rooms
to conform to the requirements.

MAY APPOINT A
WOMAN AS ONE
OF HIS STAFF
Perplexity of School
Superintendent.
CANNOT GET MEN TO SERVE
SELECTION OF A. L. JORDAN THE
ONLY CEBTAINTY.
Superintendent of Schools Webster has
found it such a difficult matter to per
suade members of the department to ac
cept positions of "assistant deputies under
him at the salary of $150 per month, as
fixed by the Board, of Education, thut
yesterday he expressed his opinion that
he would be obliged to name a woman
for one of the places. In fact, he says
he has several names under consideration,
but had not finally made up his mind
whether the necessity for appointing a
woman was unavoidable or not. He saya
further that he had already received sev
eral protests against any possible Inten
tion he may have had to appoint a lady
and, strange to relate, the protests do not
come from the sterner sex. The fact that
a deputy superintendent must report on
the qualifications of the teachers and the
conditions of the classes as he or she
may find them makes it peculiar that the
ladies are averse to one of their own sex
performing the duties. . .
The only name Mr. Webster has posi
tively decided upon for one of the places
Is that of A. L. Jordan, who is now his
principal assistant. The other three dep
uties have not as yet been decided on.
Mr. Webster finds that- the low salary
and the ten years' practical school-ex
perience required -by the charter for the
position have limited his scope of availa
ble tandldates. Men who have the neces
sary experience decline to give up the
higher salaries they are now earning to
work at duties considerably more ardu
ous that they are at present performing.
Director Casserly's recent suggestion that
."young men- be given a chance to grow
up with the work" does not find much
favor with Webster, who thinks that Cas
serly is evidently not. familiar. with the
ten-year requirement In the charter,
which effectually bars the said young
It is believed nothing, would please the
board better than to appoint Mr. Web
ster's deputies, providing he consents,
which is quite likely if he cannot get the
men he wants to serve at the $150 stipend.
In fact, it is said the board placed the
salary at that figure with the sincere ex
pectation that it would be impossible to
get desirable men who would serve at
that price. If the board be allowed to
appoint the deputies, it is more than like
ly the salary may be raised to $200 or
even $250 a month, a figure which Su
perintendent Webster and Chairman
Mark both agree Is Just and proper.
THE grave closed over the body
of betrayed and deserted Amy
Murphy yesterday forenoon, and
before the sun had set the prison's
steel clasp was upon the llvinc:
form of Horace Poulin. the man wh<>
chewed her the way where lay shame and
a miserable death.
Though he has been brought to know
the interior of a prison cp!l it Is not
likely that the courts of earth can punish
this man. but when Poulin goes into the
world again it will be as a wanderer from
the city that has been his home for so
long. Discredited by those who have
known him. discharged by the firm in
â¢whose employ he had been so long, and
unable to make new connections because
of the path of degradation he has chosen
to follow. Horace Poulin will leave San
Francisco to try life in some place where
the darker fide of his character has not
been ghown to the public gaze.
The Incident of Amy Murphy's passing
out of the world is now practically closed.
Whether she committed suicide or was
murdered may still be a question in the
minds of some who have followed the
case; but the only thing now, after the
clods hov#> fallen on her coffin, that can
revive public Interest in the case would be
the accidental turning up of the pistol or
the locating of the man who reported the
discovery of the body. Either of these hap
penings would probably only result in the
further substantiation of the suicide
theory-
Acting Chief of Police Biggy. though re
alizing that there was no law under
which Poulin could be punished for the
killing of Miss Murphy, was determined
that if it lay in his power Poulin should
be punished in some way for the wrongs
done her.
Actuated by this determination Mr.
Biggv yesterday afternoon had a tele
phone message sent to Poulin at the office
of the Eisen Vineyard Company asking
him to come to headquarters. Poulin hap
pened to be there, and soon after 5
o'c.ock he appeared at the station. Un
der an order from the 'Acting Chief he
was taken to the City Prison. He was
fcooked on a charge of "adultery." in or
der that he might bÂ« held until the law
could be looked up and a determination
reached as to whether he could be prose
cuted under any of the statutes for his
offenses against morality. The Acting
Chief himself plunged into the statute
books to find something to cover the case,
If possible-
Acting Chief Biggy was very angry
Â¦when he lu-ard that Poulin had been
booked at the prison for "adultery." He
had had him taken there merely to be
held until the law could be looked up.
Under the statute In cases euch as these
an adultery charge will not lie unless at
least one of the parties Is married.
Poulin was placed in one of the large
barred compartments where petty offend
ers are confined. He soon struck up a
conversation with one of the several in
the "cage" with him and seemed much
Interested. :>*-<
"Say. give me time to collect my
thpughts, won't you?" he said when
tsked in the jail office about matters con
nected with his case. "This is a new
thing for me. I never was in a jail be
fore. Of course I know you fellows
haven't any sentiment In matters of this
kind. It if=n't your business, but my
head's Bwimming. Don't crowd me too
much. You know I've got a few things
on my mind."
Poulin walked about nervously while
saying this. There was a weak but not a
forced smile on his lips, his face was pale
end he pulled between words at a cigar
ette. He Is of slender build and has a
generally dissipated look, though he Is a
neat dicsser. A friend was ushered in to
see him and he said:
"Don't stop at anything till you get me
out of here. Hunt up Judge Pierce and
state the case to him. I want to get away
from this place. It's warm in here. I'll
tell you what I want pretty badly â a
'jolt.' Get me one if you can break in
here with It."
Poulin was urged to give up the missive
that Amy gave to Maile for him. He said
he tore it up the Sunday morning after
he saw her at the Carrolton. Asked about
its contents he declared at first he could
not remember them, but finally said that
to the best of his remembrance they were
as follows:
Dear Horace: I have $20 05, balance from
; the German Savings Bank, tvhlch I send you.
i I have told Mr. Mail*- all about our relations.
j Au revoir. AMY.
There was no intimation of suicide In
: this note. Poulin declared. It was
! wrapped up with the money, he said. The
money he put back in Amy's purse.
"I am 2b' years old now," said Poulin,
"and cair.e from Montreal to San Diego
lin 18S7. I worked there two years as a
i printer on the Union and then came here
j and went to work for the Eisen "Company
as a.n office boy. I have been with them
j eleven years and now ha\Â» to give up a
] ]>ositio.i that pays me $300 a month. I re
signed yesterday because the firm's busl
i ness would be hurt bjr my further con
i r.ectlon with it. No, 1 am not going to
| seek another place here. I am going to
â¢ leave San Francisco at once and for good.
' I feel the humiliation that this matter has
! brought me and want to get away from
jit for good. I don't know where I will go
yet: only I must leave here and cut it all
I out.
"Did I promise to marry Amy Murphy?
! I don't care to talk about that. I have
j talked enoughâ too much. I suppose
they'll take me back to my cage now.
Well, there's something interesting in
those people In there with me."
The books of the Eisen Company show
that Poulin was not boasting when he
i paid he had worked up to a position worth
; $300 a month. Though to outward appear
; ances he is not a man of. strong charac
ter, he must have ability, for he is a
capable salesman.
Amy Murphy was not the first victim cf
1 Poulin. There is a young woman now
j living elsewhere in this State, and mar
] ried, who was led astray by him two years
ago. Her people arÂ«* well known in this
city. This girl was taken from his clutches
I and perhaps saved a fate similar to Amy
j Murphy's. After y her marriage Poulin
I threatened to bring suit against her for
j breach of promise, with the purpose of
i blackmail, the police declare.
The funeral of the dead girl was held at
10 o'clock yesterday forenoon from Mo-
Avoy's undertaking parlors. A large
crowd attended Mrs. J. C. Dart, mother
of the df-ceased. was present, heavily
veiled. Many women were weeping dur
ing the affecting scene. Rev. J. A. B.
Wilson of the Howard-street Methodist
Episcopal Church, preached the funeral
s-ermon. He spoke strongly of the dan
gers that beset young girls, and said dur
ing his discourse:
On occasions like this I thank God for ray
Southern birth.
I was reared in a country where we would
kill men for crimes like this.
I hope to seÂ« the day when the protection
of woman by the use of the pistol on the. part
of fatherÃ or brothers of young plrls like thin
<lÂ«-ad child Mrlll' bC made Justifiable homicide
in every State of the Union.
Mrs. Charlotte Edholm spoke of the
necessity of protecting young women In
great cities, and hymns were sung by
Mi&s Balllnger of thÂ»s Rescue Home on
Fol=om street and Miss Gates.
The interment was in Laurel Hill Ceme
tery.
Poulin was released at midnight on
JltXKi cash ball, furnished by T. M. Mc-
Lachlan.
THE LATE MRS. JAMES PHELAN.
mRS. JAMES PHELAN, mother of the Mayor, died at the family res
idence on Valencia street yesterday mornir.g. Since last Thanksgiv
ing day her life has been despaired of, and it was- feared that her
two daughters, who were in the East, might not again see her alive,
but for several weeks the patient was sustained, and when the end came she
was surrounded by all her children. One week ago it seemed as though Mrs.
Phelan was about to regain some of her former strength, but Monday morning
she suffered a third relapse, and her physicians at once declared that there
was no hope of another rally.
Mrs. Phelan was a descendant of one of the most historic families of the
. ancient Irish nobility. She was formerly Miss Alice Kelly, daughter of the
late Jeremiah Kelly of Stradbally, Queens County, Ireland. The family de
scended from the O'Mores of Leix, which line was almost exterminated at the
fearful massacre of Mullagast. Among the treasured relics in the Phelan
family is a cross of St. Louis, bestowed on the O'Mores for bravery during
the French wars, and which descended as an heirloom to Mrs. Phelan.
The Kelly family came to this country over half a century ago and settled
in Brooklyn, N. V., where Mrs. Duval, a sister of the deceased, still lives.
It was in New York that Miss Alice Kelly met James Phelan, her future hus
band, who went West to lay the foundation of the vast fortune which he after
ward accumulated. In ISSB the marriage should have been performed, but
when James Phelan was about to leave California to go East and claim his
bride his brother Michael died and delayed the journey. The next year, how
ever. Miss Kelly, accompanied by General Joseph Lane and Hon. Lafayette
Grover of Oregon, came to this coast, and in May, ISSD, she. became the, wife
of James Phelan, the ceremony being performed by Archbishop Alemany in
old St. Mary's Cathedral.
With the exception of a few trips to her old home Mrs. Phelan has re
sided continuously in this city since her marriage, and all of her children were
born here. Nine years ago her husband died, and by the terms of his will
Mrs. Phelan was given a life interest in the city and country establishments
o? the family and an annual Income of $30,000. Her unpretentious mode of liv
ing did not require more than a small proportion of this magnificent income,
and the larger part has been used to aid the. less fortunate. It has been dis
pensed In such a manner, however, that the right hand knew not the mission
of the left. Mrs. Phelan was very earnest in her observance of religious
duties, and so long as she was able she was regularly in her place at St.
Ignatius Church. AY*
Mrs. Phelan was born 73 years ago. Her children are James D. Phelan,
Miss Mollle Phelan and Mrs. Frank J. Sullivan.
The funeral will take place to-morrow at 10:30 o'clock from St. Ignatius
Church, and the ceremonies over the grave, which will be at Holy Cross
Cemetery, will be attended only by relatives and friends..
LIVELY SCENES
WHILE LOADING
THE AUSTRALIA
Freight Blockades on
East Street.
HONOLULU LACKS PROVISIONS
A BIG LOAD WILL LEAVE ON THE
MAIL STEAMEB.
East street from Market to the Oceanic
dock was crowded with heavy laden wag
ons from early morning yesterday until
noon to-day. Teamsters cursed and
swore, pedestrians crossed the thorough
fare at their peril, electric cars were
blockaded and there were several pitched
battles between the drivers of the horse
cars and the drivers of the wagons.
Through it all the horses enjoyed a well
earned rest and as they got their three
square meals throughout the day they
doubtless would not object if the blockade
lasted for a week.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's mail
boat Australia is to sail for Honolulu to
day, at 2 p. m. Little or no freight has
reached the islands for over a month and
in consequence almost all articles of food
are at starvation prices. Potatoes are a
luxury in the Paradise of the Pacific at
the present time. When the Australia
was there a small sized tuber was worth
5 cents, and the chances are they have
doubled in value since then. This is only
an Instance, as nearly all the staple arti
cles of daily use are very scarce.
No wonder tuen that when the Aus
tralia began to receive freight there was
a rush of gooda. At 8 a. m. it was im
possible to get within a block of the
wharf and Sergeant "Tom" Mahoney. and
a squad of police had a hard time pre
serving the peace. At 10 a. m. they nad
got the line straightened out so that out
side teams could come and go, but at 3
p. m. the heavily laden wagons were still
three deep from the Oceanic dock to Mar
ket street. On the wharf Captain How
ard had everything in splendid working
order. There was no confusion and the
loading of the mall steamer went on with
a rush and wknout a hitch.
There' is almost twice as much freight
offering for Honolulu as the Australia
can carry and the chances are that the
Zealandia will be put on the run. She is
now fitted out and ready for the Cape
Nome trade in the spring, but she can
easily mai.e a trip to Hawaii before the
rush to the gold fields begins.
The transports are beginning to move
again. The Conemaugh will begin load
ing horses to-day and will sail for Ma
nila via Hilo to-morrow. She will be fol
lowed by thr> Leelanaw in a" couple of
days. The Meade will load freight and
will probably get away about the 18th
inst. The Thomas came off the dock'
yesterday and will follow the Meade on
the berth. The Board of Examiners met
yesterday and discharged the Manauense
The report of the Board of Inquiry, which
has taken evidence In the matter of the
aUeped unseaworthiness of the vessel, will
be ready in a few days.
The British ship Clackmannanshlre Is
once more on her way to Europe with a
cargo of wheat. While making her way
down the Columbia River she was In col
lision and the fluke of her anchor was
driven through one of the after bow
plates. The cargo in the forepeak was
removed, the damage repaired and now
the ship that ia named after the smallest
county in Scotland is once more at sea.
The. tug Annie lost her smokestack
through the carelessness of the crew of
the transport Thomas early yesterday
morninr. The Thomas came down from
the drydock during the night and berthed
along the end of Howara -street wharf.
.To keep her In position, a line was run
ahead to Mission street wharf. The An
nie came along in the dark and Captain
Fitchworth proceeded to enter the slip,
never dreaming there was a line across
It. In an Instant the Annie's smokestack
was gone and the tug is now laid up for
repairs.
The Commissioner of Navigation has
authorized the change of the name of the
steamer Ira waddy to that -of Charles D.
Lane. The steamer is owned by the Wild
Goose Mining and Trading Company, of
which Charles D. Lane is an owner.
