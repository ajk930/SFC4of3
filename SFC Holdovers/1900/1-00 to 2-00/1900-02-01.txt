Fka^kf-ort Ky., Jan. 31.â -William Goebel was shortly before 9 o'clock to-night sworn in as Governor of Ken
tucky, and J. C. Beckham a few minifies later took the oath as Lieutenant Governor. The oath was adminis
tered to both men by Chief Justice Hazlerlgg of the Court of Appeals.. The plan to make Goebel Governor was
set In notion early in the afternoon. A statement was prepared saying that the boards which had heard the con
tests for Governor and Lieutenant Governor had decided In favor of Goebel and Beckham: that the boards In
tended to report their findings to the Legislature, but that they had been prevented from doing so by the ac
tion of Governor Taylor in declaring the Legislature adjourned. The statement then goes on to say that the mem
berÂ« of the Legislature were driven from place to place by the militia and threatened with arrest whenever they at
tempted to hold a meeting. It was declared the belief of all the signers of tho statement that Goebel and Beckhan.
were the legally elected Governor and Lieutenant Governor, and each man as he signed the paper announced that he
\oted for the t'Joption of the majority report of the contest boards, which declared Goebel and Beckham 'to be the
men rightfully entitled to the offlce. The statement is signed by a majority of the members of both houses. o

FRAICKFORT, Ky.. Jan. SL-Never
was there a more complicated po
litical situation than that which to
night confronts the politicians of
Kentucky, and never was there one
cf which it seemed so difficult to form an
accurate guess at the outcome.
William Goebel, who was shot down by
an assassin yesterday, received the oath
of office as Governor pf Kentucky to
night. What the legislators were kept
from doing publicly they accomplished by
etea'.th.
All day through the streets of Frankfort
soldiers marched and countermarched.
Drills in the street were frequently held.
In order that the men might be warmed
by exercise after they had remained in the
biting wind.
Around the Penitentiary was a line of
troops, in front of the opera-house was a
jruard. three companies stood at rest in
the open space in front, of the Capitol
Hotel, seritriejs rmtroj I le.i.every.slde Qf the

r*~^def and a attachment of infantry held
thÂ«* courthouse against the possible com
ing of the members of the Legislature
with the Intention of declaring that net
the living William S. Taylor, but the
dying William Goebel. was the lawful
head and extcutlve of the commonwealth
of Kentucky.
Th<Â« Republicans laid their plans we.l
end secretly. They carried them through
vigorously. The proclamation declar
ing that a Ftate of Insurrection
existed in the State and warrants for
the arrest of every Democratic mem
ber of the Legislature were prepared last
night. It was the intention of Governor
Taylor and his advisers that no meeting
of the Legislature should be held to-day
even though it proved necessary to arrest
end detain In custody all those who per
sisted in holding meetings. Once adopted
the policy was carried out to the letter.
Compelled to retire from the Capitol
building they went to thÂ«Â» opera-house.
Held back from the opera-house they
went to the courthouse; pre\*ented from
entering the courthouse they went to the
Capitol Hotel, only to be told that any
meeting they might attempt to hold in
that building would be suppressed, all
found taking part in it would be arrested
and the hotel itself seized by the soldiers.
It was a hopeless game. The Democrats
fcad no chance to win and they gave It
up. Later In the day officers entered the
hotel and told the Democrats that no con
ferences should be held and they at
tempted' to hold none.
Governor Taylor and his attorneys re
mained all night In the State House.
Threats had been made against all of
them, and it was thought the wisest .thing
tor them was to remain where they were
until the excitement had In some degree
abated.
This morning not a mtnbtr of the Leg
islature knew whether or not the body
would be permitted to meet In the Capitol
building. They knew that soldiers were
guarding every jrate and that nobody
would be allowed to enter without a pass.
They decided, however, to meet at the
Capitol Hotel and. march In a body to the
Capitol. Clerk Edward Lee of the House,
with Representatives Kilday and Lewis,
formed the advance guard and at 9:40 they
presented themselves at the south gate of
the Capitol grounds. A young lieutenant
was on guard. In command of a' small
Fquad. As soon as the members of tne
Legislature were Identified they were ad
mitted and allowed to pass Into the Cap
itol building.. Not a soldier was In eight
on the outeide of the building, but once
the door was opened it looked like war.

Burns can't buy his way into the
United States Senate with their
votes.
They have honorably and va
liantly obeyed their sense of pub
lic duty under the stress of temp
tation that should land the tempt
ers in the State penitentiary.
These legislators have been
threatened with the weapon of
the Southern Pacific blacklist,
that will rum them in business,
and they have stood only more
firmly to their posts. They have
been offered the bribes of place,
patronage and power, and they
have rebelled. This much they
have done, and certainly tney
will not undo their splendid
work. It is natural that they
should be apprehensive, for
there is no trick or treachery that
the Mexican does not know.
So to the end they intend to
be vigilant. They have cast
Burns out, but they are not haz
arding what they have so stub
bornly won by neglecting to
watch everj* movement of the de
feated Mexican. They are con
cerned now in seeking a man
who shall be acceptable to all
and against whom no finger of
suspicion can be raised. â¢ There
are many aspirants in the field.
Scott,. Bard, Barnes, Pillsbury,
Barham, Paterson, Knight,
Shortridge and others are in the
field, and each has his friends and
followers.
How to reconcile these clash
ing claims and from the field
draw the favorite is the problem
of the independent legislators.
The fight is absolutely an open
one. The only hope that the
people of California can have is
that the best man may win.
The finish of the most remark
able Senatorial contest in the
history of California is not re
mote. D. M. Burns, who entered
the race without the knowledge
or consent of the people, now
recognizes that his defeat is in
evitable. The Southern Pacific,
sustained by members of the
Legislature, who would have
been defeated if they had given
to their constituents the slightest
intimation that they intend to
support the Mexican, has balked
the Republican party and de
prived the State of representa
tion in the United States Senate.
The Southern Pacific manag
ers one year ago haughtily re
fused to listen to the demands of
the people that all the candidates
should be retired in order that a
Senator might be chosen. Gen
eral Barnes, R.- X. Bulla,*U. S.

Thomas R. Bard were wiling to

MENTO, Jan. 31.â
' The splendid fight
against D.M. Burns has been
fought and won. As The Call
announced this morning, . the
Mexican will hear his fate in the
caucus. â¢ The Republican mem
bers of the Legislature will meet
to-morrow night in this caucus,
and after organizing and taking
a few complimentary votes will
probably adjourn until Monday
night. The proposition of delay
was 1 made in. desperation and de
spair by trie demoralized forces
of, Burns: It will be acquiesced
in by the determined- opponents
of the Mexican, not because they
wish to show him any considera
tion," but because they have
driven him from the field "and
knowing: that he is o nb longer"; a
factor in the fight Â° they want
some time in o which to fix upon
a candidate , wKo will" worthily
represent" the State.
.'.-'" oThis* is the situation to-night
in the battle that is absorbing
the attention of the people of
California and creating: interest
at Washington. The significant
fact of the day is the absolute
knowledge that Burns has been
beaten. He has exhausted even'
artifice and subterfuge of corrupt
politics to stay the flood of indig
nant public opinion which is
sweeping him from the political
field in which he has been an ob
noxious presence. He has tried
with bribes of money and- of pa
tronage to break the ranks of de
cent legislators which are so sol
idly facing him with the stern
menace of. political destruction.
But he is striving in vain. His
master and paid champion, Wil
liam F. Herrin, the Democratic
head of the law department of
the Southern Pacific Company,
is powerless to help him in his
fatal plight. Herrin has over
estimated his' abilities to corrupt.
He may. have power to seduce
Supervisors with the jingling,
dazzling influence of coin, but he
has undertaken too serious a
task in seeking to prostitute the
independent members of this
Legislature, who value their rep
utations â¢ and their . honor as
above price. They have resented
the command to bare their backs
to the railroad brand, and D. M.
on each side of the hall with fixed bayo
nets. At the foot of the stairs leading
to .the legislative halls stood Colonel
Williams and behind him a detachment
of soldiers completely blocking . up the
stairs. Colonel Williams carried in his
band a large bundle of papers," one of
which he handed to each member of the
House as they passed him. It was a
copy of the proclamation given above.
Colonel Williams permitted Clerk Lee,
Assistant Clerk Henry Stone and a few
Representatives to pass- up the stairs.
Then the main body of the Legislature
came tramping through the doorway and
they were stopped by the- soldiers in an
Instant. Loud cries and exclamations
filled the air. and Colonel Williams,
mounting half-way up the stairs, shouted:
CALIFORNIA'S POLITICAL OUTLAWS. AT THE DOOR OF THE FEDERAL SENATE.
"Gentlemen. I hold In my hand a procla
mation Issued by tbo' Governor of Ken-"
tucky. which I will read."
He then read the proclamation In a loud
voice and directed an orderly to pass
copies of the proclamation out Into the
crowd. The legislators were coming in
too rapidly, however, and the pushing
and shouting made It Impossible for any
explanation to be given the late, comers.
Adjutant General Collier then mounted
the stairway and read the proclamation
a Â«Â»econd time. "When he finished a Rep
resentative shouted:
"Mr. Chairman^"
"Well." said that gentleman, with a
laugh, "where is London?"
"It is In Kentucky," yelled another
voice. " hjgggjl

DEMOCRATS HAD A
MOST UNIQUE PLAN
FRANKFORT, Ky., Jan. 81.-The Dem
ocrats had a unique plan for getting the
Legislature to-night which would have
been carried into effect if they had not
succeeded in obtaining the necessary sig
natures to the Goebel and Beckhaxn state
ment early in the evening. Frank Keenan
played "A Poor t Relation" at the opera
house to-night, and it was the Intention
of the Democratic Senators and Repre
sentatives to go to the entertainment one
by one. At the end of the . first act.
Speaker Trimble was to mount the stage',
call the Legislature to order and adopt
the majority report of the contesting
boards. The scheme would have prob
ably been carried to a successful Issue
had the members decided to attempt it
Extreme vigilance is .practiced by ali
the guards around thl State House
grounds, to-night The orders are more
strict than they have been at any time
heretofore, and nobody without a uniform
is allowed inside the grounds. All passes
issued earlier in the day were taken ud
whenever presented. v
WHITTAKER YET
DECLARES INNOCENCE
LOUISVILLE, Jan. 81.â Harland Whit
taker, who was suspected of having shot
Senator Goebel and who was brought here
last night from Frankfort, was somewhat
nervous to-day as a result of the excite
ment, but he still persists in asserting hia
innocence and said he had no fear of the
outcome of his trials
"f did not shoot Mr. Goebel," he said,
"and never thought of 'doing so. I was
there simply as a friend of Taylor to see,
with the others, that he had justice done
him. I was sitting in the State House
wnen we heard the shots fired. Two other
men were there and they were talking
about insurance. One of them had a
brown beard, and : if they will they can
come forward and clear me. But I am
not afraid, for I know, I am innocent and
that when the case comes up I will be
cleared.^ They cannot convict an Innocent
man. They can't show Â¦ where I shot at
Mr. Goebel, and all there Is against me is
that I had the pistols; but if they arrested
everybody in Frankfort who was armed
half the population would be in jail before
the day was over." Â¦ .
So many .people called at the Jail to see
Whittaker that Jailer Pflantz ordered him
confined In an upstairs room. No one is
to be allowed to call on him during the
remainder of his confinement simply be
cause they are curious to know how the
suspect looks. He will be allowed to see
the : constables and newspaper men, but
outsiders are to be shut out. . -. .Â¦Â¦ â¢ ' Â¦ Â¦

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO. Jan. 31.â The xontest for
Senator was enlivened somewhat this afternoon by the announcement that
Thomas R. Bard of Ventura had been Invited by fifteen of his supporters
to come to Sacramento again and engage in the fray. There was one dis
patch signed by the whole number, and besides there were several separate
messages of encouragement. The Bard boom has the merit of coming from
a sources outside of the Burns camp. It is doubtless Herrin's plan to keep
as many candidates In the field as possible, with a view of discouraging and
confusing the opposition to Burns, but the invitation to Mr. Bard was not
prompted by a suggestion from the Southern Pacific law department. Among
the signers to the telegram were: Senators Flint. Jones, Rowell, Bulla.
Smith, Gillette, Currier, Taylor, Assemblymen Greenwell, Conrey, Mellck..
Cosper, Valentine, Merritt and Chynoweth.
SHERIFF DECLARES
HE SHOT GOEBEL
LOUISVILLE. Ky., Jan. 31.â James Sut
ton, Sheriff of Whltely County, who came
here from Frankfort last night, is a
prisoner In the County Jail. At an early
hour this morning at the Victoria Hotel
Sutton went up to the office of the clerk,
brandishing two revolvers.
"I am the man who shot Goebel," he
said, "and I will never be taken alive."
The hotel manager promptly sent for
the police and on the appearance of the
latter Sutton ran upstairs to the third
story and when he thought he was about
to be captured opened a window and
leaped out. He alighted on his feet, was
uninjured and ran nearly a mile before
he was arrested. The police believe that
Sutton is either decidedly unbalanced
mentally or that he knows who shot
Goebel. An effort to Interview him after
he was lodged in Jail proved unsuccessful
He lay In a dark corner of his cell and
refused to say a word.
FEDERAL INTERFERENCE
IS NOT YET WARRANTED
WASHINGTON, . Jan. 8L â Secretary
Root Is authority for the statement that
there is nothing in the situation in Ken
tucky calling for , Federal interference.
He is credited with the remark that the
State authorities are perfectly . able to
deal with the situation and are not likely
to call on the General Government for
assistance. Federal troops will be or
dered to Kentucky only as a last resort,
and only then upon representation of the
State authorities that they have exhausted
all their resources and are powerless to
deal with the situation. General Merrltt,
commanding the Department of the East,
and General Brooke, lately Governor-
General of Cuba, were at the War. De
partment to-day, but their visit was a
mere coincidence, and there is the best
authority for the statement that their
presence .in the city has no reference
whatever to the possibility of the use of
Federal troops in the settlement of the
troubles In Kentucky.
It cannot be learned that .the change in
the situation in Kentucky, resulting from
the adjournment of the Legislature, has
altered the views of the administration as
to the wisdom and necessity for interven
tion with troops in the State affairs.
. One member of the administration as
serted, regardless of the terminology em
Â£loyed in the news dispatches, .that' the,
.eglslature was technically in a state of
recess. If that be true, of course, the
power to call for troops could not be ex
ercised by the Governor at this
time. â¢ Another member pointed out
that even assuming that the Leg
islature " stood adjourned, yet the
United States constitution provided that
the Governor's call could be recognized
only when the Legislature could not be
convened, and he wanted to know if it
was asserted that this state of facts ex
iÃted. When the point was made that the
United States troops might go into Ken
tucky without call to protect the prop
erty of the United States and the 'mails
and interstate commerce, It was suggested
that so far it had not been shown that
any of those interests were ever re
motely endangered by, the developments
at Frankfort. Altogether, as already
place aside their aspiration?, but Herrin
arrogantly said that the Senator should
he Burns or nobody. Throughout tho
long regular session ' the . battle wab
fought on these lines. Measures of cor
ruption, monstrous and despicable, were
invoked to bring members of the Legis
lature into the corral of Burns.
Leading Republicans in every section of
the State who voted for Gage on the posi
tive assurance that the policy of the
State administration would not be dic
tated by the Southern Pacific road or -Its
agents remonstrated against the contem
plated outrage of placing Burns, the de
faulter. In the United States Senate, but
remonstrance was of no avail. Heedless
of popular protest and contemptuous of
r>arty principle. Herrin, the Democratic
manager of the corporation, declared that
Burns should be elected. Members of the
Legislature weak enough to yield to
temptation were debauched and dis
honored to promote the ambition of the
corrupt boss.
The Republican State Central Commit
tee was betrayed into wicked alliance
with the agents of the Southern Pacific
to foist the discredited boss on the Leg
islature. Petitions from the populace and
prayers from the pulpit were scorned by
the programmers. The patronage at the
bestowal of the chief magistrate of the
State was secretly if not shamefully held
in reserve to reward the hirelings of the
Southern Pacific corporation. With every
element of corruption working to betray
the Republican party fifty-five stalwart
end honor-abiding members of the Legis
lature stood true and firm In the cause of
the people. The Call then proclaimed that
the defeat of the corporation and the
downfall of Burns should strengthen the
party in the confidence of the people and
more than compensate the State for the
loss of representation in Congress. Events
have established the truth of The Call's
prediction. Burns is on the ragrged edpe
of political despair, the arrogant South
ern Pacific corporation has had notice
served upon it and its agents that the
Republican party will not take .. orders
from the law department of the company.
â¢ The dark hours of the long struggle to
rave the State from the shame of repre
sentation by a defaulter have passed.
The friends of good clean government are
courapeous and confident. There is as-
Fu-;r ; ce that a Senator will be elected and
th. t he methods and proceedings of his
? leci.jn will redound to the honor of the
State. BBE3R
. While thÂ« defeat of Burns is acknowl
edged the touts of his following have not
been ordered home by Herrin. They still
cling to the delusion that several of the
fifty members who have signed on their
honor never to vote for Burns in caucus
may be persuaded to break their sacred
pledge. So small an estimate do the rail
road hirelings place upon the Integrity
of puMic men that they speak of the vio
lation of solemn and sacred pledges as
mere incidents of a political campaign.
. To-day the plain truth of the situation
may be told to the Southern Pacific by
ex-Surveyor Brown. The facts will con
vince even Herrin that Burrs cannot win.
Money will not save the Mexican from
defeat. The mere suggestion that the
pack if to be opened to bring some^ofahe
waverinp and doubtful ,to the corral of
the Mexican produces indlgr.ation ; in the
ranks of the twenty-seven members' who
have so far supported Burns without any
material contribution from the funds of
the corporation. If money is introduced
they will demand a large share for past
servitude before they agree to deliver the
eoods.
The calm Judgment of men who have
had long experience in the politics of
California is to the effect that the contest
has passed the corrupting stage, hence
Burns Is no longer a factor. His person-
COMPLIMENTARY VOTE
FOR EX-SENATOR WHITE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31.â Major P. J. Hamey
of San Francisco, who was selected for the honor of Democratic support for
United States Senator in the contest pending in the Legislature, has with
drawn In favor of Hon. Stephen M. White. When Major Harney was selected
to enter the field of candidates, he was advised that Mr. White's health
would not rermit the ex-Senator to engage in politics. Subsequently it was
ascertained that White's health was much improved, hence Major Harney
insisted that the compliment of Dtmocratic support should be given to a
statesman who had ably served California In the United States Senate.
ality will shortly be eliminated from the
struggle. Doubtless he will endeavor to
make the best terms possible with the
successful candidate in order to protect
the railroad touts who have remained
loyal to the company and the bosses. A
significant fact now develops. Candidates
fcpeak of Burns in softened tones. It is
realized that the Mexican is In possession
of a small Mock of votes that he may
transfer for personal friendship or politi
cal reward; hence there Is a disposition
to avoid- a course that will provoke tho
wrath of the defeated aspirant.
â¢ The twenty-seven men comprising the
Burns following at the present time are
looking around on their own account to
make arrangements for thoir future con
duct in politics. They comprehend that
their leader is down and cannot get up
again In this Senatorial fight. Some of
them are not ready to go down with him.
The election of a clean Senator will
surely be a great triumph for the people
of California, irrespective of party. The
flection of a Senator whose selection was
rot dictated by Herrin and the Southern
Pacific will be a superb triumph for the
Republican party and one that will add
twenty thousand votes to the Republican
column in the great political contest next
November.
. Much of the credit for the great achieve
ment will be Justly accorded to the fifty
five stalwart men who fought for good
principles and clean candidates from the
first ballot in the regular pepslon until the
present hour. It is a foregone conclusion
that every man of the Burns following of
twenty-seven will be retired to political
obscurity. The mere record of their un
broken allegiance to. the cause of the
Southern Pacific against the expressed
wishes of the people will consign them
to oblivion.
The anti-Burns forces to-night decided

pointed he would demand that the clerk
of the last session (F. B. Mott) be reap
pointed. Valentine of Los Angeles also
objected upon the ground that if more at
taches were appointed a rearrangement of
the appropriation would be" necessary. A
number of other members gave notice
that if one clerk were appointed they also
would demand recognition and insist that
ail of the old force be reinstated. De

walk and handicapped themselves by
numerous posts, boxes and pedestrians
that filled the way. When the law
makers arrived all they obtained for their
run of a quarter of a mile was the privi
lege of standing on the opposite side of
the street and gazing at the opera-house,
the front of which was occupied by v a
panting line of soldiers In double rank,
with fixed bayonets. General Lyons, the
oldest and most corpulent in the House,
had, despite his physical drawbacks,
managed to beat the soldiers and get Into
the hall. He> was politely requested to
come out, which' he did with the remark,
"It does not look as though a quorum will
get In."
Thomas Heffner, the owner of the opera
house, demanded that the. members of the
Legislature should be admitted. \ It was
private property, he claimed, and the
militia had no right to keep anybody from
it. He was completely Ignored by Lieu
tenant Colonel Gray. Speaker Trimble
stepped up "to Lieutenant Colonel Gray
and demanded entrance to the hall. ;It
was refused. Turning around, Mr. Trimble
addressed the crowd:
"Gentlemen, we are denied admission to
the opera-house. We will now adjourn to
the courthouse."
Away went, the crowd with good
natured yells of derision at the soldiers,
who had ordere to remain at the opera
house and could not -leave. The triumph
of the lawmakers was short lived." 1 Before
they had gone 100 feet from the opera
house, around the corner swung a second
company of soldiers directly in their path.
The second heat of the race was now on.
and away went the dignified Senators and
Representatives down the street In . a
cloud of dust, yelling like a pack of . In
dians. Alongside ran the soldiers. It was
the same story over, again; and the legis
lators were permitted to look at the out-
Bide of the courthouse, while the soldiers
held their path. General: Collier had ar
rived ;by this time, and Speaker Trimble,
advancing , from the crowd, said, "Don't
shoot, general." . ?. Â» .'
"I am not going to create any- trouble;
I won't shtot unless I have to," was tnÂ»
reply. . ** V
"We wish to be admitted to the court
house." said Mr. Trimble. Both men were
smiling.
"It cannot be done, gentlemen," said the
general, calmly.
Speaker Trimble announced: "TJi* Leg
islature will now adjourn subject to my
call." ,
The crowd dispersed.
There Is much doubt among the mem
bers of the Legislature as to whether they
will go to London at all. Some of the
Republicans left . Frankfort during the
day, declaring that they were going direct
to London, but no Democrat sol declared
himself. The words "London, ' Laurel
County," are not worfls that please Demo
cratic ears. In fact, many of them de
clared that their lives would nof.be safe
after they reached that town.: It is a
place of about 1000 inhabitants^: situated
In what is known as the "feud country."
The Inhabitants are mostly mountaineers
and laTgely of a . most enthusiastic : type
of Republican faith. 1 The county, is qge of
the greatest Republican: strongholds In
the State. , The people' of Laurel ' County
are intensely for Taylor .and Intensely
against Goebel and all his works.- It Is
this latter feeling that causes the Demo
cratic members of the Legislature to feel
hesitancy about venturing at the present
time, when party feeling runs bo high
and ibltter ; from end to end -of i the State,
within the confines, of Laurel. County, or
Into 'the neighborhood of London.-

that when the' proper time

Similar statements are said

The Call's information is from an inside source and can be accepted by the public
as the claim of strength advanced by Burns to deceive himself and his gullible followers. It
is known to The^Call and to. many of the members of the Legislature that twelve of the men
claimed by Burns to make a showing are absolutely pledged against him. For. example,
Cutter, Morehouse, Anderson and Atherton, who have never entertained the idea of voting
for the colonel, are on ttieilist." Eight other members who are openly opposed to Burns
and have resolved never to vote for him are on the Mexican's list. When the men who are
openly and sincerely opposed to the colonel see their names on the Mexican's list, they will
resent the publication as a reflection on their character and intelligence, and freely vent their
indignation on the newspaper.- The Call, however, is simply publishing the news, and in or
der to obtain all the news, special effort was made to ascertain upon what a slender thread
the Mexican's hopes of success hang. ' . .
. Â¦'..Â¦Â¦: Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦/-, To-night:^ohe'-of Burns'confidential managers sized up the situation in the colonel's
camp and confessed that. the extreme limit of Burns' strength was thirty-five votes, and that
the vote of ojie man -ofrthe thirty-five depended on a certain contingency. This estimate of
the' thirty-five very^nearly tallies with the figures given by the. stalwarts. Of the eighty-five
Republican members pf:the Legislature, fifty are pledged solemnly and sacredly never to
vote for Burns in caucus. Wright being absent there are-only thirty-four Republicans to be
accounted for, hence the Mexican cannot, get thirty-five unless Wright is brought to the cap
ital. ' There are those among the Burns adherents who do not .look with favor upon the
scheme to adjourn the caucus over to Monday. Speaking of- that proposition to-night, As
semblyman Cobb said: "I do not 'see the necessity for any such adjournment. If we have
got the votes we claim! don't see why tHey should not be shown on the first ballot, and have
done with it.! If we haven't got the votes, I want' a chance to vote^for some one else. What I
want is to see a Senator elected and with as much dispatch and as* little expense as possible,
and I will certainly follow that policy. It's time to. quit politics an'd' be Republicans."

and he will be there, against the protest
of Ms physician.
The Assemblyman was struck by an
electric car at the corner of Fifteenth
street and Broadway last Friday morning.
His hip was badly bruised and dislocated
and he sustained a concussion of the
brain, which rendered him unconscious for
nearly a day. He is still at Fabiola Hos
pital and at no time since the accident has
he been able to sit up. It was announced
that he would be taken to Sacramento
to-morrow and he will be taken into the
Republican caucus, even In his injured
condition, so that he may cast his vote,
presumably for the man ! he voted for
during the greater part of the last se
flon. the man who would even sacrifice
the possibility of his recovery for a vote-
Dan M. Burns. Wright announced a few
days ago that h^ intended to go to Sac
ramento and it is apparent' that he is
going to carry out* his promise.
He could not be seen to-night, as he was
suffering from extreme nervousness and
the hospital authorities wanted to keep
him as quiet as possible In preparation for
to-morrow's trio.
"Mr. Wright Is going to Sacramento to
morrow," said Dr. Llliencrantz, his phy
sician, this evening. "His political friends
have insisted upon it and I have been
compelled to yield. I shall bandage him
up in the best way possible and prepare
him for Â»he trip, which will be a trying
one. If I could control the matter I would
keep him in bed and absolutely quiet. He
is in no condition to be moved at all and
excitement Is extremely dangerous". . The
exigencies of politics appear to. demand
his presence at Sacramento immediately,
however, and I have had my advice ig
nored." â¢ Â¦.. â¢ ..â¢â¢',

Â¦ ?
THAT WATCHFUL INSTITUTION
HAS A STORMY MEETING.
' CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 31.â The session of the Good
Government Club ended to-night almost
in a riot. The- members indulged In a
fiery fusillade of left-handed compliments
at one another and had not calmer coun
sels prevailed one of the Institutions of
the legislative sessions would have been
only a memory. The' row, strangely
enough, was all over a proposition to elect
Mayor Phelan of San Francisco a mem
ber of the club.
.The Good Government Club, as every
one knows, meets in Sacramento during
every session of the Legislature. Its pur
pose, commendable to every devotee of
the higher politics, is to supervise- the
measures introduced in each house, to
keep a watchful eye upon legislation, to
detect the "bugs" and "jokers" in pro
posed laws, and to exercise a kindly In
terest in all legislators, particularly those
from the metropolis. The Good Govern
ment. Club in Its day -has been honored
by many prominent members. When the
president, Sam Rainey. rapped for order
to-night and Secretary Martin Kelly
called the roll the set faces of some of
the members indicated that something of
unusual importance was in the wind. All
the members were present except Dr.
Dille. The indications were perfectly cor
rect. Somebody proposed the name of
Mayor Phelan of San Francisco for mem
bership. Who it was will never be known.
The room was In an uproar. Then the
voice of the secretary was heard. "Elect
that man a member?" he shouted.
"Never: his character is such as to bar
him. Elect a man who makes pledges and
breaks those he can't keep? Elect a man
who stuffs a police commission and then
can't deliver the, goods? Elect a man who
plays both ends against the middle and
then throws everybody down? What are
you thinking about? Have you forgotten
our pledges for good government? â¢ I can
stand a good deal, but I've got to draw
the line . somewhere. I will never sully
the records of this Good Government Club
with that man's name/ â¢ Â». ' -.
' This eloquence of the secretary- won the
protest and the club adjourned, with an
avowal never to mention the name of the
Mayor again. And when it was all over
the members. found the president of the
club under the table in a dead faint with
the roll of the Fire Department clutched
in his hand. He had dropped at the
Bound of the Mayor's name. : -.*/* .-â¢ v

It was possible to see them they were
only seventy- : yards off, and our foremost
line sought shelter behind rocks. At this
stage the first Boer shell burst and tho
order "was given for one regiment to re
tire to the edge of the kopje, where there
was more cover. The order was miscon
strued, by some in the foremost trenches,
who fell back. The Boers seized this op.
portunlty and rushed the trenches, cap
turing a few men. This mistake was ob
served, a. bayonet charge followed and
the Boers fled. Two of their Maxlni-
Nordenfeldts commenced to drop 'shells
among us, doing terrible damage. The
Boer riflemen noticing the havoc wrought
attempted to creep close up on two occa
sions, only to be driven back with loss.
As they retreated they appealed to our
men to surrender. Our response was a
volley.
The formation of the hilltop Is like a
table, a mile long and a quarter of a mile
broad. The shorter side alone was availa
ble for rifle fire. The firing party which
responded to the Boer attack was neces
sarily small. The remainder of bur force
was scattered about, seeking shelter.

strong impression that before, long
the Government will mobilize/A re

- LONDON, Feb. 1, 4a. m.â The . supplemental lists of casualties fill two columns in nonpareil type
in the morning papers, making 1300 reported thus far from General Buller's operations north of the
Tugela: The Daily Chronicle estimates that the total exceeds 2000. The 40 per cent loss at Spion Kop is
greater than any British force ever suffered, except possibly at Albuera, Spain, in 1811.
. The Admiralty has warned all half-pay naval officers to hold themselves in readiness for service.
This, with the fact that able seamen not thoroughly experienced have been withdrawn from the Chan

denuded of troops, the steps taken by
the Admiralty have much meaning. Un
der ordinary circumstances the ships of
the channel squadron, which have been
refitting at Portsmouth, Devonport and
Chatham would leave about this time for
thÂ«>ir usual spring cruise. The Admiralty
recognizes the defenseless condition of
the country and the squadron will pro
ceed to Ireland for a short cruise, so as
to be near at h^nd In case of need.
In the meantime J*-jis likely that the
reserve squadron woula be mobilized ready
to stand sentinel at Portland when Vice
Admiral lUiwson takes his powerful fleet
from Ireland to Gibraltar, its usual ren
dezvous when political clouds gather.
At a meeting of the members of the
House of Commons who have served in
thÂ« navy or army a resolution expressing
absolute conflder.ee In whatever measures
the Government might think necessary
was defeated, only two voting for It.' The
meeting adopted instead a resolution urg
ing the Government-lo take steps at once
for the formation of a force consisting of
infantry, cavalry and artillery for^ the
purpose of home defense.
On the field of war there Is 'no appar
ent change In the situation. Nd'dispatches
stating new moves reached London yes
terday, although there were rumors from
Natal that another attempt to relieve
Ladysmith would be made.
The War Office^ announced that it had
received no confirmation of the report that
General Buller. had said to. the, 6 troops that
he hoped to be In Lady smith within a
week.
According to the latest Information, the
retirement from Spion Kop seems Â£o have
been Inevitable. When reinforcements
and a few guns arrived during the night
the position still held by the British forces
was so confined that the various reg
iments were huddled together and It' was
impossible in the darkness to make proper
arrangements to meet the storm of shell
and bullrts that daylight would bring
upon them. z Â¦ '
From General Bullcr*Â« force there Is no
further Information "except that the big
guns were Ktill at Mount Alice on Sunday,
with Lyttelton's brigade covering them.
Generals French, Kelly-Kenny and Gat
acre in Csp<v Colony are pushing out their
mounted men toward each other. If there
la any effort on, the part of the Boers in
the Zoutberg district to drive Kelly-
Kenny back the forces on the east and
west will do what they can to threaten
the flanks of the advancing Boers.
It is not likely that any severe fighting
will take place for pome time in this sec
tion. The Boers atColesberg. Stelnsberg
and Stormberg seem to be content if they
can keep the British troops In check while
Cronje operates between. Modder River
and Klmberley.

Inner circle of the Afrikander Bund con
cerning what should follow the ripening

MUCH OPPOSITION TO
THE MASON RESOLUTION
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.â The Mascn
resolution In the interest of the BoÂ«r-re
public received attention at the hands of
the Senate Committee on Foreign Rela
tions to-day. There .was not a full at
tendance of members and definite action
upon it was postponed. The sentiment of
the committee as expressed by those
present was practically unanimously op
posed to action because of the effect upon
other rations than the two involved In
the African- war. This expression was so
general as to make quite certain that no
affirmative action will be .taken on the
resolution.
DULL DAY IN THE
HOUSE OF COMMONS
LONDON. Jan. 31.â There was an utter
lack of interest in to-day's debate in-the
House of Common?, j At no time was the
public gallery well filled. ' The speeches
were . academic, traveled in deep- worn
ruts, aiididld hot-touch upon the future,
in which, alone ;the. public is much inter
ested.' The only- sign of animation during
the, ..whole session was when Sir Robert
Thrcshie Reig attacked the South Afri
can committee, drawing forth cries from
the Irish members of "Publish the
Hawkesley letters."
A. J. Balfour. replying to the sugges
tions of Sir John Ilenry-Kennaway, Con
servative merriber for the-Honlton divis
ion of: Devonshire, said he regretted that
it would be contrary to precedent to cur
tail, the debate, as the amendment was a
vote of censure upon which the fate of
the Government depends.
William St. John Broderick, Under Sec
retary of Foreign Affairs, closed to-day's
debate.' He generally traversed the in
dictments of the opposition, which h*
characterized as "Immortal" at such a
time- as the present. No Conservative, he
added, defended the .raid, from which, he
claimed, the" 'Government had suffered
more than' onybody. .because, when the
raid was precipitated President Kruger
"had almost reached the end of his,tether
with his own burghers en account of his
treatment of Uitlanders."
House then adjourned.

that it would 'be useless to storm Lady

was the officer who ordered the retire

adds: "It Is due to him to say that I be

cult .situation -early January 24, and that
under a lossof;at least 40 per cent he
directed the defense with- conspicuous
courape and ability- throughout the day.

HONOLULU. Jan. 24.â Honolulu's j
Chinatown is purged by fire. That
plague-spot Is a thing of the past.
As a result the bubonic plague is
now believed to be under control.
It Is expected that a few sporadic cases
Mill develop in the next few days as a di
rect result of Chinatown contamination,
but beyond that nothing more serious is
looked for. . j
On Saturday morning, January 21. 1300. j
the Honolulu Fire Department proceeded
to the corner of Boretania and Nauanu
streets, in the quarantined district, to
burn a portion of block, 15 by order of the
Board of Health. They firÂ»>d a building
en Beretania street, intending to have the
fire back up against the wind, which was
blowing from the northeast. The entire
Fire Department and four engines were
en hand to prevent the fire breaking away
from their control. One engine was placed j
at tlie corner of Beretania and Mauna- .
kea streets, in readiness to extinguish j
any fire that might result from flying em- |
.bere All went well for a time, but sud
denly the wind- freshened, and the fire
with it. The high wind carried burning
embers over into burned block No. 10. At
last one of the embers was lodged on the
eastern tower of Kaumakapill Church,
netting it afire.
Unfortunately the Fire Department was !
unable to force th<? water to a height suf- i
flciont to reach the new blaze, which was
consequently permitted to burn its way
into the church. The edifice was packed
with the most valuable and rich Chinese
and Japanese mcrchandt&e brought thcie I
lor temporary safe-Keeping, and later i
fumigation and disinfection. It is deeply i
regretted that this fine old church haa to <
go It was the most historic of all re
ligious landmarks.
NVxt the Chinese jos?-house, near the i
church, was afire >. and panic and terror
seized almost every rÂ«s=ictnt in the <tuju
antined district. With cries and ye'ls
they went racing through the streets,
eprea'djug the alarm, and soon the streets
twarmtd with Chinese and Japanese car
rying sucn cf their belongings as ihey
cared most in save. The rtatnes spread
more and more, and swept toward the
river and the harbor front.
It was now evident tnat nothing could
ctnp the advonce of the fire; that all
Chinatown was doomed. The breakaway
cf the fire was so strong and eudden that
the Fire Department was Â«-o;npeHed to
atandon the tiro engine stationed that
mcrning as an extra Â¦precaution at the
corner cf Maunakea and Beretania
streets, and it v.as instantly enveloped la
Harness and destroyed.
When the firemen realized the confla
gration was neyond their control thÂ»'>
bent all their, efforts to ciieck it in its
course. Thpy-ran their; hose down the
ttreets, citizens helping, and threw watet
on the bnUdlnsfc er.dr.r.grred. but to no
purpose. The heat absorbed the water,
arc then the lire secured a new hold on
the tinder-dry houses and swept on until
it burned itself out. at the harbor front.
Dynamite was resorted to to blov up
houses to check the fire, but the effort
was of no avai;.
When the first alarm was rpread that
the fire was i;Â«?yond control, the Chinese
and Japanese wt-re seized by a frenzy of
rage and terror that alracst terminated .n
a riot. Over 7000 Chinese were confined In
the quarantin-wl burned district. When
they rc-MSzed the danger, of losing t.ieir
home? and belongings arid possibly their
lives they gathered into bundles as 'arge
as they could drag away their most
valued belongings and endeavored to
break through the quarantine lines. Ih-s

NKW MAN, Jan. 3l.â J.C. Middleton, who
hart a ranch In the Coast Road Range,
be alarmed over the plague in Honolulu.
In Hongkong, where he was formerly sta
tioned, .the plague is ever present, but
practically no precautions are taken in
the United States against infection from
ships from that port. No such efforts to
stamp out the plague were ever taken in
China or Manila as have been taken In
Honolulu. The drastic measures adopted
here for the extermination of the -plague
would not be tolerated in the States.
Dr. Carmichael said that Federal
officers were very much hampered in the
efficiency of their work because territorial
laws are not yet effected, so they are in
a measure powerless to act. He bellevyd
that now the center of infectlpn had been
destroyed an early death to the. plague
would result. He applauded the very
rigid house to house inspection because
every suspicious case could be Isolated at
once and infection be reduced to the
minimum. He believed the local Board of
Health was entitled to a great deal of
credit for the manner in which it had
handled the situation. But for its thor
oughness more serlpus results could have
been apprehended.

ROOF DEMOLISHED

Special DlsDatch to The Call.
STOCKTON*. Jan. 31.â The tearing down
of the roof above a woman's head while
she slept or half dozed in a drunken stu
por on a mattress was a scene which oc
curred yesterday af terr.on on Lafayette
street, in this city. Some weeks ago a
man of Spanish extraction walked Into
Dr. Fisher Clarke's office and died while
sitting on a couch. His identity was not
known at the time, but became revealed
when the body was removed to tho
Morgue and a woman visited that place
to view the remains. The woman claimed
the dead man as her husband.
The house in which the couple lived and
In which the woman has been living since
the death of the man, was tne property
of George S. Ladd. A few days ago thÂ«
owner announced that he was about to j
tear down the house, and the woman
moved some of her meager effects. She
left there, however, an old mattress, and
yesterday she went back to the house in
a maudlin condition and took up a posi
tion on the couch. The workmen were em
ployed all around her, but left the front
room In which she lay until the last. A3
the shingles and boards came down one
by one the woman met the workmen with
a curse. At last they reached the tront
room and commenced to, unroof that part
of the house. The woman would not arise
and Officer Walker was sent for. He was
unable to see. the woman, and would not
arrest her in a place of which, she held
possession, as she was committing no dis
turbance. It was decided to let her leave
of her own accenS and then tear down
the remainder of the house before she
could return. The woman left some time
last night, and this morning the structure
was demolished.
POLITICS IN SCHOOLS.
Professor Jordan Says the Moral and
Educational Effect Is Bad.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Jan. 31.â
President David Starr Jordan to-nlghl
addressed the students upon the BUbject.
"Politics in the Public Schools." The
noted orator took a decided stand against
the use of personal or political "pulls'*
when the public must pay the penalty.
The system which allows private political
debts to be paid with public trusts was
sharply criticized, while the teacher -who
knows more of palmistry than of psy
chology and is in the profession until she
can marry out of it came in for her share.
The influence of such persons upon the
children that come under them can be
but the worst. In pointing out the
remedy for the existing evil Dr. Jordan
said:
"We need first boards of trustees that
have the Interest of the schools at heart
and who will give the time and thought
necessary for proper administration.
Second, superintendents of schools who
shall know schools on the one hand and
teaching on the other, who shall know
educational aim? and ideals and the
means by which they may be carried out.
Third, a corps of trained and able teach
ers, whose knowledge may be a source of
Information for the pupil and -vhese
character will be inspiration. When we
have these three things and all divorced
from political or personal Influences we
shall have reason to be proud of our
schools."
Professor E. P. Cubberly also spo'ce
taking "Teaching as a Profession" as his
topic.

BITTER DEBATE
THE SENATE
Admiral Dewey Assailed
Â¦;.;â¢Â¦ by Pettigrew.
â¢ WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.â Debate in the
Senate, ordinarily calm and dignified,
burst to-day into passionate utterances
and bitter recriminations.- â¢ Senators
hurled denunciation, one at another,
until the auditors quivered with excite
ment. The debate grew out of a phase of
the Philippine question, and no scene
has been witnessed since the discussion
of the war resolutions in the last.Con
gress, which, In 'sensational features,
compared with that of to-day.
Pettigrew, who has precipitated nearly
all of the debates upon the Philippine
question ' during the . present session,
sought to have read a resolution em
bodying a document written by Emilia
Aguinaldo upon the Filipino Insurrection
and containing his version of the. alleged
recognition of the Filipino republic by
Admiral Dewey.
Lodge of Massachusetts . ' protested
against printing the ' document In any
form, and read a letter from Admiral
Dewey in which -that portion of Aguin
aldo's statement relating to the admiral
was denounced as "a tissue of false
hoods." â¢"Â¦ . â..
'"'Senators on the floor listened with eager
attention, and . many gallery . spectators
leaned far over the railings in their de
sire not to miss a sentence. Lodge said
he preferred accepting Dewey'e word to
that of Agutnaldo and was satisfied the
American people would also.
In a passionate reply Pettigrew declared
that. Admiral Dewey had recognized the
Filipino republic, and. although afforded
an opportunity heretofore to deny Aguln
aldo's statements, had not done so.
In an Instant a half-dozen Senators
were on their feet. | Hawley, the venerable
Senator from Connecticut, denounced Pet
tlgrew's action as treason.
In rapid succession Pettigrew was made
the target of stinging arraignments by
Spooner, Hawley, Sewell and "Galllnger.
That the feeling was at a pitch 3?ldciin
noted in the Senate was evidenced by the
pale faces of the men who spoke.
Jones (D.) of. Arkansas and Teller of
Colorado endeavored to stem the Mde'cf
protest and deep feeling by. conciliatory
speeches.
At the conclusion of the scene, which
will remain memorable in the Senate an
nals, the financial bill was taken up and
discussed by Berry of Arkansas and Tel
ler of Colorado. ...":>

SAYS SHE WAS ROBBED

Mrs. Willard H. Colby, the wife of a

experience. . " -
Mrs. Colby says that a few days ago.
about 8 o'clock in ths evening, she was
walking on Nineteenth street, near Dia
mond, when she was attacked by two
men. One of them seized her by ?> tho
thioat, she says, and told her to, keep
quiet or they would "{five the Coroner a
Job." She says she attempted to scream,
but was overpowered, and thrown to the
ground. On recovering, she says }Â¦ she
begged for mercy,' promising to point out
to the men where $20 was secreted in her
house if her life were spared. Then,. Mrs.
Colby says, she lost consciousness to, be
discovered by her little daughter at S>
o'clock the following morning lying at the
head of the stairway leading to her flat,
three and one-half blocks from the scene
of the alleged, assault. All she missed,
she told the police, was $22 from her
nurse, $13- of which belonged to a neigh

Colby had volunteered to-pay to their
common -landlady, and the key to the
front door by which the alleged robbers,
were said to have entered. Â¦ She com
plained of pains in her head and back, and
on a white shirt' waist that she wore
pointed out some stains of blood.
The police are .investigating the case,

Police Commissioner William J. Biggry on

PHELAN'S VERBAL
BOUQUET TO BIGGY
IN his message to the Board of Supervisors, .delivered. January 3, 1599. '
Mayor Phelan took .occasion to split an infinitive, and. throw, a. deserved
bouquet at William J. Biggy. As . It will make interesting .reading at
this time it is taken bodily from page 20 of the printed message and prer
seated as follows: . Â¦'/Â¦'".Â¦. ..Â¦â¢';Â¦. ' f '.'Â¦ '.'.Â¦Â¦ :\ ''Â¦ 'Â¦". Â¦ ."-
In contrast with the extravagance of the School Department
and the County Clerk's office I desire to officially commend the Reg-:
istrar of this city and county, W. J. Biggy, for the great saving
which he has effected in two elections held during the last calendar .
year and for the honorable administration of his office. Â¦.
Quakes with fear every time its shameless
masters pull the string. It feels that it is
deserted by every friend It had and is en
tirely ct the mercy of its owners.
This feeling Is warranted by the facts.
Nobody stands now with the little Mayor
but Esola and his backers, an unscrupu
lous newspaper and Dr. McNutt. a good
physician and a poor Police Commission
er. Against this little band are arrayed,
to begin with, Police Commissioner
Thomas This may seem surprising, but
nevertheless it Is a fact. Commissioner
Thomas is no longer with Phelan, al
though he fought for him as long as he
thought his given, word demanded. He
l^ft town last night for Los Angeles, but
before his departure he : told several
reputaMe genttemen that, whether or not
his resignation was accepted, he wouM
never cast- his -votÂ« for Esola, who, ht
declared, was unfit for the position.
Commissioner Thomas has felt that way
for some time. The fact that he handed
in his resignation indicated It, even if his
direct statement had not been made. His
course in the beard, while it has been a
puzzle to his friends, can probably be ex
l>laJned by the statement that pains had
been taken to predispose him in favor of
Ksola and to *xtort a promise of support
from him . before he realized the conse
quences of that promise.. His word, once
gTlven, even : though gained by false pre
tenses. Commissioner Thomas sought: to
keep faith until he could no longer bear
the strain. Only one thing was left to do

Esola plotters are, as they have always
been. Commissioners Newhall and Blggy.
Neither, upon taking office, would have
been unwilling to oblige the Mayor and
vote for his . choice for Chief of Police,
but, . after hearing the testimony of the
man with the alias, they could not stom
ach Esola. They are still strong in that
determination, although there is no doubt
they would EtJH vote for any other choice
of the Mayor that was competent for the

A still greater, force, however, opposed
to the little Mayor and the other .sponsors
cf Esola, Is found In the array of former
frienrts of Mr. Phelan, who, disgusted at
his barefaced prostitution of his office,
have arrayed themselves against him.
Joseph Britton was the first of these pub
licly to set up the standard of revolt.
Following him comes Henry N. Clement,
also a Freeholder, a framer of the char

which the head of the municipality has
given over his office. Two weeks ago.

McQuald replied that, the only facts to
which he could testify were that he ha.d
reason to know that Bogy's conduct dur
ing his 'term as a State 1 Senator had bt'en
conspicuously :honorable- iri ev-ery.- way;
that Blggy had not only paid his railroad
fare; .but he Indignantly . resented ah'at
temp"! to give him a pass. The incident
to which -McQuaid referred-happened- in
January, 1593, and is not the one in which
the Examiner is floundering:. It serves,
however, to illustrate- Biggy's character.
"Late last Saturday night." said Mc-
Quaid to-day. "I was visited by these two
attorneys and asked If I could give, them
any information against Bisgy. I told
Â¦them that I knew nothing that mfeht re-
J fleet on his character, und, more than
that, I did know that he Was absolutely
above reproach while in the State Sen
ate. I told them of one Incident that Jus
i titied my opinion. Â¦,-â¢'. Â¥â¢Â¦Â¦ / â¢' â¢â¢ â¢'
I "In January, 1593, a Joint committee
j from the Senate and the Assembly went
I on a tour of inspection to Southern Cali
fornia. Blggy was a member of the com
mittee and as I was Interested in River
side legislation I wished to impress- upon
the minds of the members of the com
mittee the desirability of paying some at
tention to Riverside in their Journey.
But that was my affair and serves only
to show how it came that I have abso
lute knowledge that Blggy would accept
no favors from the railroad people.- I
know positively that Biggy was given trr
understand that he could have had a pass
If he wanted one. I know also that he
indignantly refused to listen to the sug
gestion.
"When the joint committee left Sacra
mento I went to the depot to see them
away and I saw Blggy purchase a ticket

Coming Century," Senator William Lind
say of Kentucky; "California and the
Commerce of the Pacific Coast," Senator
George C. Perkins of California; "Trade
and Transportation in the State of New
York," General Francis V. Greene; "The
Humorous Side of Politics," Congressman
John M. Allen of Mississippi.
The spirit of commercial expansion per
vaded all the speeches.. The declarations
of Senators Thurston and Lindsay in fa
vor of upholding the national adminis
tration in. the Philippines were heartily
applauded. In the course of his speech
Senator Perkins said: .: c â¢
For fifty years California has looked east
ward over the mountains and deserts of the In
terior of the continent, for. eastward ran the
linrti of trade. In future she will also look
westward over the' bread PaclJle. for westward'
will the future lines of trade be run. .â¢
The battle of -Manila marked the end of one
i-ra and the beginning of a new one for'Calr

f'.rnia is not the only State looking upon.. the

Is .a arrest, work which mu.Â»t be undertaken .at

I'aclflc ' Coast is now m6t>t favorably 'situated
to secure the share which, belongs to it. â¢ But
the great States eaet of the Rocky Moun
tains are at a. very great disadvantage when
compared with their agricultural and indus
trial competitors, in Europe. With the opening
of the'Nlcanjgua canal the situation will be
immediately changed. , The distance from New-
York to Asiatic -ports wfll be so reduced that
the greÂ»t American metropolis will be the cen
ter of our Oriental trade. A waterway across
Nicaragua win at once transfer the. present
advantage of European marts to this side of
the Atlantic. The entire western coast of the
two American continents will be brought nearer
to the Atlantic i>ort* by over one-third of the
circumference of the earth.. Â¦
What kind ox Government shall be estab
lished "n the Phlllrplnes In place of that al
ready estahlliied Is yet to be determined. Jus
tice to both the Filipino and the American
niuht be maintained. Until the Filipino has,
through ths Influence of a Just and humane
government, advanced In civilization to the
point reached by American labor ' In the field

tented with having afforded him the means of
rising to that standard. That means will be

What to Do When the Nurse
Says "It's a Boy."
/I â¢: ; ; By ROBERT J. BURDETTE.
A TALE OF TWO CITIES.
SAN FRANCISCO is not .the only municipal
storm center in . the country. There are other
..troubles than purs and. other cities are in tor
ment. Chicago is feeling the irritation of a Mayor,
who has recently made a. declaration whiqh virtually
amounts to an assertion that he is the government^
that the Aldermen need not think, that the heads of
departments need not think, that the people need not
think/ thatrthe.'Maybr. wni;do - all the thinking and
the *' rest > of. the community may saw wood and say
notlling,, Philadelphia is trying to. reconcile. two re
form parties, into a -sweet: harmony which; will en
able them to reform 'the: city by; first reforming them
selves, and T e\v r ork 'is .harried ; by. anxious
thoughts of possible combinations of the Republican
machine with, the ; bemocratic machine for the grind
ing of grist that \ will "go into the sacks of politicians
only. Those, however, are common troubles, not
w4!lely different from, those that beset ourselves, but
there' are 'two' cities Whose pains are of a diverse na
ture and of a keener pang, and to them in their suf
fering some attention should. be given. .
First of the two is Boston. . In that center of in
tellect Hal: life /and blue stockings : v the ; unmarried
women are at. war against the married women. The
causfe of the strife is that the spinsters have" banded
themselves. together into a society calling itself "The
Association for the Preservation of the Rights of
Unmarried Women." The particular right they are
seeking to preserve just now. is; that Â¦;' of earning
wages, and to accomplish it they propose that.no
married woman shall be employed as a wage-earner
in Boston so long as any unmarried woman remains
without employment. It. is a battle between women,
but every man who. employs labor is involved in it'
and for the time; being Jife in Boston is not widely
different from existence in Hades. . . . .

A CHANCE fOR A HEARING
AA.YOR PHELAN'S announced intention to
remove William J. Biggy from the Police
Commission gives a promise that the- people
may yet have an opportunity to have the whole of: the
Mayor's bargain with Lawrence brought to light/by
an investigation in open court- If an attempt be made
to remove him by autocratic power upon some mis
erable pretext the Commissioner will have; the; right
cf an appeal to the courts, and then will come th?
exposition. Â¦Â¦ , ' '/ â¢ . ' 'Â¦'
Under such circumstances the determinatipn. of
I'helaa and Law^nce to remove Commissioner
I-iggy and put a pliant tool of their own in his place
will be one of those outrages that carry a remedy
with them. In fact, for the sake of getting a chance
to have 2n examination of the affair in court, the
public might be willing to see the Mayor undertake
to remove t'e Commissioner who has stood for. the
indfpcndcr.ee of the board and for an honest.admin

Tlic Call has repeatedly charged that prior to the
election' Mayor Pheian entered into an illegal a:id ne
farious bargain with Lawrence and others to turn
the Police Department of the city over to them in
case of his election..' A\"ith each reiteratipn of the
clKirge The Call has challenged flavor Phelan to sue
it for libel in orderthat the truth of; the' charges
?nijjht be made known by 'sworn' testimony. The

When Gage called the extra session of the Legislature he thought things had
been fixed for the election of Burns to the Senate. The Governor has; since
learned that 'everything.- has not been flxfd. but, on the contrary, that the. mem
bers of the Legislature are no nearer to the selection of the colonel as Senator
than they were on the last day of the regular session. Of course, there are
Burns men who make extravagant claims, but the anti-Burns men point out
that in 120 ballots at the last session Burns gained jttst four votes-, and further
state that In the face. of all claims no one has been able to lay finger upon a
single man who voted against Burns last session who proposes to vote for him
now. The wide publicity which has been given to the names of the anti-Burns
men and the general suspicion against men in this category who may change, will
have a tendency to stiffen the backs of these who might otherwise weaken.,

"MACBETH" BY
AMATEURS A
BIG SUCCESS
Greditable Work by
Students.
r ,: Â»
If St. Ignatius College Hall had been',
tT?lce Its size it would not have, contained
the audience drawn by the performance of
'"Macbeth" last evening by the elocution
classes of St. Ignatius College. The seat- Â¦
ing capacity of the college theater Is said
to be 2000. but invitations were extended
to nearly twice that number, and a* a re-,
suit there were many disappointed ticket
holders. '.
The production of Shakespeare's trag
edy was under the direction of Professor
C. B. Newton and the success which
crowned the efforts of the amateurs was
gratifying to him. The performance went
through without a break and the manner
in which the play was staged, would havo
been a credit. to any of the professlonaf
managers now before the, public. ' The
scenery In the five acts was not only cor
rect In every detail, but was beautifully
painted. The witches' glen, the hall In
the palace at Forres. Blniam wood, the
ramparts of Dunslnane Castle and other
Important pictures in the tragedy were
truthfully, and realistically depleted and
some of the costumes w,ere brilliant.
It was regretted that Lady Macb.-th and
Lady Macduit wer^ omitted from the cast,
but this was made absolutely necessary,
as young ladles do not attend the college.
Their absence, however, did not mar the
production, nor did it haVe a tendency
to lessen the applause which followed
each heroic speech. Â» â¢
Throughout the evening music was ren
dered by the college orchestra. Following

erately fostered by the Tudor chroniclers.
Beginning with Polydore Vergil, the his
toriographer of Richard's conqueror, ami
Thomas Mere, the disciple of Bishop Mor
ton, Richard's most dangerous enemy, the
tale of the usurper's crimes grew blacker
and blacker, until In the popular histories
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
It is the picture of a monster rather than
a man that confronts us.
According to their reports. Richard s
malignant disposition showed Itself on the
day of his birth. He came Into theworld
with teeth and long hair down to bta
shoulders. He was "little of stature, ill
featured of llmmes. crooke-backed. nla
left shoulder much higher than hi* right.
His face wa* small, but his countenance
cruel and such that at the first aspect a
man would judge it to savor and smell of
malice, fraud and deceit. When he stood
musing he would bite and chew busilie
hi* nether lip * * * beside that me
digger whichhe wore he would (when he
stuaiod) with hfs hand pluck up and down

the evil omens of his birth and Â£PPÂ«ar.
ance. At 19 years of age he had a hand in
the savage murder of the Prince of Wale 3
at Tewkesbury. Two days later he sent
to the block the Lancastrian nobles whose
lives thfr King had swotn to spare. \\ Ith
in the -month he "slewe in the towre

child stood ' between Richard and the
throne and bade him make short shrift,
"for by St. Paul (quoth he) I will not to
dinner till I see thy head off." In .his
greed for the throne he did not scruple to
cast a slur upon the character of his own
mother, spreading reports that "neither
Kin* F.dward hlmseli nor the Duke of
Clarence, among those that were secret
in the household, were reckoned verle
pureliefor the children of the noble
Duke" (Richard's father). Hypocrisy
joined hands with treachery and murder
to help him to the throne, and what he
had sought for along such bloody paths
he professed to accept only at the urgent
wish of the people, protesting his entire
love and devotion to his brother's chil
dren. . . . - r \" -s
,- Of Â¦ all . crimes" laid to Richard's charge
none provokes more bitter Indignation
than the murder of the Princes In the
tower." His other victims at least were
â¢men, enemies or rivals. The Princes were
helpless children ; and his own nephews.
The details of their taking off were hid
den for years; men only Knew that the
children were no more: and with unerring
Instinct popular judgment pointed to
Richard as, their murderer. When the
truth came out In his successor's reign
the pent-up anger knew no bounds, and
the pathetic story of the children's death
In .tfte -pages 'of. More gives voice to the
wrath and sorrow of a nation. - -*f .:
But Richard. was suspected of an even
blacker crime. After the death of his son,
a child of whom Shakespeare knows noth
ing, he cast his eyes upon his niece, Eliz
abeth, 'the "true heiress of the house of
York. His persuasions drew this lady
from her mother's keeping in sanctuary,
and at the same time he spread abroau
a> report of his wife's death. Hearing this
rumor, she feared, so the chroniclers re
port, that -Richard had judged her worthy
to die, and soon after, "either by pensive
ness of heart, or by infection of poison
(which is affirmed to be most likely) the
Queen departed out of this transitorie
life." So strong In fact did the suspicion
grow that Richard had murdered his wife
to marry his niece, that in order to re
tain the fidelity even of his firmest parti
sans he was forced to declare publicly and
with an "oath that he had never enter
tained the Idea of this union.
But c Richard did not escape, said the
chroniclers, the 'fit Judgment for his sins.
Rebellions broke out In the land; the old
supporters of York and Lancaster made
common cause against; the usurper. Many
=who fought under.? Richard's banners
"'hated him worse .than- a toad or a ser
pent, ' wishing and Â¦- working his destruc
tion." On the eve of the decisive battle
he had ;''& dreadful and terrible dream;
forjit seemed to him being asleepe that
he did see diverse Images like terrible
divels which pulled and haled him, not
suffering him to take-anle quiet or rest."
On the morning rumors of treachery ran
through his army. In the tenfof the Duke
of r Norfolk was found a rhyme bidding
him refrain from the battle.
"Jacke of . Norfolk.: be not' too bold.
For Dikoa. thy .master. Is bought and eoliL"
In his address to his captains Richard
showed the remorse that weighed upon
him. confessing that In the obtaining of
the crown he had committed **a wicked
and detestable act, which, nevertheless, -I
trust to have expiated with -strict pen
ance and salt'Uears." Finally when the
battle was joined Lord Stanley, on whose
aid the King had counted.' led his troops
to Richmond's side, and. Richard, scorn
ing to flee, rushed into the thickest of
the fray, shouting "Treason! Treason!"
and. then fell, pierced with countless
wounds.
Attempts have been made to clear the
character, of Richard and inaccuracies
and even positive errors.=have been point
ed.out In the popular conception. But In
spite of all,- the tradition remains the In
terpreter of the facts of history; and the
latest authority on this perl<fl assures us

Inquiry from Pajo Alto came over. the.
telephone to the Presidio yesterday re
garding the army standing of a certain
Henry Luhr, who is down there repre
spnting himself as a second lieutenant in
the army detailed to purchase horses for
the Government, The person on the Palo
Alto end of the telephone wanted to know
if he was "all right." . . -
This is the second Inquiry made at the
Presidio in regard to Henn* L-uhr. .The
former one was by two. women, who said
he had married a young lady in Oakland,
a friend of theirs, and they wanted to
make sure he was what ; he represented
him6elf to beâ a second Ueutenant of the
Thirteenth United,. States Infantry. .
.At that time Trie Call looked up his
record and found that, there was no men
tion in any of the army lists of a Henry
Luhr. second lieutenant, and a wire to
Washington brought ran answer from Ad
jutant General Corblri. He said: "There
is no. such officer, in the army.".- Â¦" Â¦ Â¦;
Luhr is a resident of Oakland, where he
lives with his parents. . He says he was
ripppinted last October iis a second lieu
tenant In the Thirteenth Regular Infan
try, and he was on "'furlough" Until Feb
ruary 6, when he would join his regiment
in the Philippines. The army lists of Npo
vember ana December make no mention
Â¦of him. ;1 1 is the custom for. army : btflcers,
?Â»Mn on.. leave or otherwise, to report at
the- nearest headQuarte.rs by letter, or in
porsbn, whenever they change. their loca
tion, but Luhr never appeared at local
headquarters, ne.ver registered to have his
>mail -sent to him. and never paid his re
priectsY.or .reported to General Shaf ter.
Then, too, "furloughs" arc only given to
enlisted menâ ofilcers are given leave,: but
no officer is given anything but sick leave
thesedays, except for very short periods.
Luhr does not claim to be on nick leave.
Inquiry at: the quartermaster's depart-

purchase, o! horses: in this State by the
Government has ceasod.'- A few horses

Fopular Conception of Richard HI.
>â¢ Richard 111 was the bogey of Elizabeth
an tradition and history. A free, united
and loyal people looked back with loath
ing' to the times when feudalism was
dying" In a horror of civil strife. The sav
age cruelty and base treachery that were
distinguishing characteristics of the wars
ct the Rosea seemed to reach their climax
in the person of the last of the" Plantag
enets, and no other actor In those wars
was so fitted to receive the full weight of
the people's detestation. Richard of York,
his father, had been throughout his life
the Idol of a great part of the nation;
Edward IV, his brother, was applauded
for his beauty, liberality and prowess In
the field, andâ what Is even more to the
po!ntâ he was the ancestor of the reigning
sovereign, Elizabeth; Henry VI, pitied for
his gentleness, piety and miserable end",
was locked upon as a martyr; even Mar
garet of Anjou, hated as a foreigner, won
a reluctant admiration from the hearts of
the people by her heroic struggle for the
cause of her husband and her son.
Richard 111 became, as It were, the scape
goat to bear away Into the wilderness the
sins of his whole generation. â¢ .
Thls conception of Richard was not only
due to popular tradition. It was delib-
which we have teen made familiar by
Shakespeare.,' t ,, â¢- . .', Â¦ -
Even were it otherwise. Shakespeare
would be justified, in his work. The prov
ince of the poet is not that of the critical
historian. ThÂ» creative poet deals with
ideas current in hia day, and when his
material is the popular conception of a
historic figure It la his part not to run
counter to that conception, but to ex
plain it. to Infuse it with poetic, life, to
humanize It. -
This Shakespeare has done In the play
of "Richard lir.'*~ He dwells upon and
exaggerates the personal deformity of
Richard as cuttinp him off from natural
affection. He points out Richard's prida
of intellect which finds the same satis
faction in a well-played stroke of hypoc
risy as the artist uoes In a perfected mas
terpiece. He develops touch by touch thÂ»
"demoniac energy of will" that drives
Richard headlong; into action. The crafty,
flery. unresting hunchback la an Incarnate
engrine of destruction. So lonfr as tho
enemies of his race kept the field he was
the sword of the house of York; when
pipinjr times of peace succeeded the
sword, like some enchanted weapon of
northern lesend, turned against Its mas
ter. Â¦ <"â¢â¢ Â¦-â" c--
And yet Shakespeare's Richard Is no
monster, awful and incredible after the
pattern of Marlowe. He Is Intensely hu
man. Cynical, treacherous and bloody, he
Is still a man. and we can understand the
motive that drives him on; unchecked by
fear or scruple, to the sweet fruition or
an earthly crown. And when all is over.
when the sword la broken and the flery

cloeln* out Â«fthe accounts of this house un

In the: speculative actirjty. though the shares

The beet prices of the day in the majority of
the stocks were made after this episode, the
demand from the short interest becoming eager
â¢md pressing for nome of the stocks which
have been targets recently for the bear opera
tions. The friirhtened shorts were fairer to
cover and It cannot be nald that the bull
contingent retained the same placid confidence
during: the latter part of the day. They were
disposed to avail themselves of the forced de
mand trom the sfcorts to realize and "prices
yielded quite materially during the last hour
The mixed sentiments thus manifested were
Â»artly due to the facts disclosed by the day's
Incident! that an important part or yesterday's
large buying was due to a reckless and In
temperate attempt to recoup beer losses by
plunring Into a large account. It was evident
that operators ehort of the general market
h.ad made a prodigal outlay In sugar which
relapsed weakly in face of an effort to realize
profits. There was very heavy covering in
evidence at various points In the list the in
dustrial stocks recently under pressure beine
rooet conspicuously affected. The very heavr
<lea:!n*s in Brooklyn Transit and a part of
the demand for Steel and Wire were attributed
to this cause. There was a very large demand
however, for Steel and Wire for the long ac
count.. The sympathetic effect on other metal
â¢tocks was less marked â¢ than yesterday. The
aggressive â¢trer.gth seemed âto impress foreign
xr.arketa and Invited some small buying de
mand from London. J Conspicuous strength was
displayed by the grangers, the coalers and
â¢ome Boutbwerterss, but the gains in tbe rall

Dealers continue to quote all . sorts of prices
for Butter. . The quotations below are close
enough. Some dealers are paying as high as
27% c for dairy. The general expectation Is that
there will be & reaction in a few days, as the
outside trade will be lost unless prices recede.
The North has already ceased to buy here.
Eggs are nezleeted and stocks continue to

BOSTON, Jan. 31.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will cay to-morrow:
Several of tho large consumers of Wool have
been tn the market during the past week and
they have purchased about all the medium and
low Wools, especially quarter-bloods, which
they oould get at a reasonable price, especially
fleeces. As a result of the almost unprecedent
ed demand for such Wools stocks of that grade
in this market must be reduced to a pretty
low point, but there are foreign Wools of the
same grade on the way to this country which
will fill up the gap. and it is needless to say
that there are more obtainable, as outside of
the United States supplies of such W ools are
plentiful. :Fine Wools are firm but quiet.
Prices generally are steady and as high as
they have been at any time and the prevail
ing feeling in the trade is one of contldence ana
strength. Holders of Wool will not concede
and consumers have to pay full prices when
they purchase. . Â¦ Â¦ 'Â¦
The sales of the week In Boston amounted to
4,204.000 pounds domestic and JM.OOO pounds for
eign, making a total of 4.454.000, pounds, against
a total of 5,120,000 pounds for the previous week
and a total of 4.666,000 pounds for the corre
sponding week last year. The sales since Jan
uary 1 amount to 17,609,G00 pounds., against 17.-
Sts3.ooo pounds for the corresponding time last
year. Â¦â¢ . .Â¦â¢'Â¦Â¦Â¦ ."Â¦'Â¦ 'â¢ .'â¢" '. -.;;â¢.

Government from $12a to $150 and often:
even more than $150. He costs more than

yesterday, r- Picking up j 121 pounds in the
seven-furlong handicap, he. defeated An-
Jou and several others quite as easily as
he did on Monday. It looks as If the son

FOUR IX)TTEBY COMPAUTES ABE
AGAIN OPEN FOB BUSENXSa
Detective George McMahon and Officer
Burke, who have been active in the sup
pression of highbinder crimes in China
town since the recent war was inaugu
rated, last night discovered and frustrated
what is considered a plot Â¦to destroy the
Suey Sing Tong headquarters and a por
tion of Chinatown with dynamite.
For several days the officers have been
unusually active on account of : the ru
mors that serious trouble would occur
after the Chinese New Year. They have
searched the headquarters of the various
tongs for weapons and explosives, but
with little success. -Last night they vls
ned: a building known as ' the : -Old- Palace
Hotel, located on Jacksoii street; between
I)uj?ont and /Kearny, and known to be the
headejuarters of the Suey Sing^ Tong/; ;li
is a two-story, affair : with a . basement
and shelters.. ; not Â¦'â¢â¢ only, .highbinders arid
Chinese .criminals- but a- number of bpiurn.
embkers!' In this, place a>quaritity'. of high'
explosives, weapons.: and a complete outiit ;
far manufacturing Â¦ : bullets. .. were found
when Acting Chief vliiggy .first raided
Chinatown. ,Â¦,-,' Â¦'â¢.; ;:â¢â¢â¢;Â¦- ,; .- â¢â¢*'/. ;Â¦Â¦.;â¢: â¢ ;.. â¢Â¦
.About two -hours Â¦' were- spent oh: the
premises : and the officers flnaily entered
a small compartment.; under a -flight of
stair*. There they were startled to find
three long 6ticks of dynamite, with fuses
attached,, and a number. ; of- -cartridges.
The explosives were taken < to the Caljfor
nia-street. Station arid .later, to the City
HalL''-'>^-:V : -v,\ -.Â¦*-â¢' -U:" : .{Â» <Â¦:; .-â¢â¢ -:..'.Â¦.: Â¦*.'>Â¦/..'
It is generally believed that the. high^
binder trouble, has not yet been settled,
and the discovery made last night
strengthens this opinion. The officers are
inclined to think tnat the deadly stuff was
placed in the building by the Hop Sing
Tong, and that a dreadful tragedy would
have occurred as* soon as the vengeful
highbinders found a favorable opportunity
to execute their design. â¢ . â¢
Last night four lottery companies
opened their places and several arrests
were made.' This is the first time they
have been in operation for several weeks.
Acting Chief Blggy and Captain Witt
man visited the Chinese quarters last
night and held a conference with Ho Vow,
Consul General. The police officials still
insist upon receiving the names and ad
dresses of the tong leaders, and will not
withdraw the officers from Chinatown un
til their demands have been complied
with. IMb said that If the tongs will notr
consent to furnish the information the
Consul General and the Six Companies
will employ detectives to secure the de
sired Information in secret, and keepthÂ«
police posted on highbinder affairs.

The publication in yesterday's Call of
the: story that Commissioner Jeremiah
Mahony had placed his resignation from

SCHOOL TEACHERS PROTEST.
Those Placed in Unasslgned List Say
Action Is Unjust.
The Board of Education is likely to ex
perience a great deal of. trouble in Its
policy of abolishing some of the evening
schools and putting the teachers thereof
on the -unasslgned list without reference
to seniority of service. Several of the
teachers made Individual appeals to the
School Directors yesterday and it is
thought that some action will be taken
at the next meeting of the board to rec
tify what Is considered as an Injustice.
The last board adopted rules in this
connection in which it was provided that
the chronological order of employment
should bo observed. This was regarded
as good law by Judge Seawell, who/ In a
decision, held that it was not only just
but legal. The board in abolishing: the
Lincoln, Washington and Horace Mann
Evening schools placed eight teachers on
the unassipned list, whereas if the rule
had been followed they would have been
either placed on the substitute list or as
signed to places In other schools. Â¦

Schereck began to play an accompani
ment on. the organ while Catherine sang

and the noise was bo terrific that . the
landlord, Henry Breuer, telephoned tothe
Southern police elation that there was a
riot In his house. . -Â¦-.Â¦,. â¢Â¦ â¢"
.Policemen Flynn and Beach were de
tailed to quell the disturbance, and when
they got there all they heard wero ; the
tones of the organ and Catherine's long
drawn-out "for, you-ou-ou." Breuer ; in
sisted on the two young women being ar
rested for disturbing the peace, bul they
locked their door and defied the officers.
The women were., finally captured by
strategy and yesterday they appeared^ in
Judge Cabaniss' court. Both expressed
their -indignation at being arrested.
Catherine said she was taking lessons -In
music and she saw no harm in singing in
her room at "9 o'clock at night. Breuer.
said that his mother was sick and Cath
erine's singing wpuld kill her unless she
was compelled to leave the house.
The Judge did hot think that the charge
would stand, but he aflvised tha de
fendants to leave the house and he con
tinued the case for two days to enablt,,
them to do so. Catherine remonstrated,
but the Judge told her that If Mrs. Breuii
were not sick it was apparent her sing-
Ing would make her sick and if she was
sick It would make her Bicker, so Bhe had
better leave. .

Gftastly Treatment
V- Sic^k Chinese;
; . Last .night .Police Officers : . Butler and
Murphy made a report to: Police Sergeant
Anderson at the" California street station
which may cause an Investigation ' to bÂ«'
made ihtp a ghastly practice now exist
ing in Chinatown. AVhile.the subject mat
ter of their report has often .been dls-.
cussed, yet no official action has ever been
taken, and the reports made.. by .the. two
patTolmen ' last night will bring the de
tails for the first time under the scrutiny
of the police. .;. ; ' ' '-,- ' â¢ ' ' . . Â¦:-':â¢Â¦' â¢.
-It has been a "practice among Chinese
.to prevent the death, of any person. In
their, dwelling houses; and to avoid:' this
the Chinese; undertaker's places 'Â¦ axe-prb
j vlded , with apartments 5 into which sick
heathens -are cast .to breathe their last.
As soon as a Chinaman becomes serious
ly ill he is immediately placed in one of
the -undertaker's bunks. He. ls given no
further v attention and. the cover of a
wooden cpifln is soon nailed upon him." .
. Early yesterday morning - Policemen
Butler arid Murphy saw a couple of men
carrying a sick Chinese In a chair to tho
undertaker shop. of the Man Fook, Coffin
Company, on -Clay., street above Dupont.
They followed them and upon entering the
place found the subject for a coffin sitting
and conversing with his companions. The
officers returned last evening and dls-.
covered that the man was dead. Inquiry
was made into the case and It was found
that the sick Chinaman had been â¢ given
a cup of some liquid, after which he gave
no more trouble to the undertakers ex
cept when they laid him In a box.
The sight of a Chinese packing a sick
countryman on his back to the door of
an undertaking chop is frequent during
the early morning hours. Most of the
unfortunates die soon afterward aa they
are given no attention and the suspicion
exists that they are often murdered that
they may be disposed of quickly. For the
purpose of ascertaining the treatment ac
corded the dying Chinese the police ofll
cers have filed a report and some sensa

QUIET and subdued Is the Chinese
New Year's celebration! The
highbinders, their bloody feuds
and dire threats have taken
some of the spirit out of It. During
the afternoon yesterday Chinatown,
save for the decorations and gaudily
dressed children, was the same as any
other day of the year. There was no
crowding of the streets, nothing of
the ceaseless rush from house -to
house, and what has hitherto been the
chief characteristics of New. Year's
celebrations, no fireworks. V . '
.It was somewhat different last, night
when ;a large number of visitors
thronged street and alley. -The "white
devils" were burdened with packages
of Chinese nuts, candy, preserves and
every description of Celestial confec
tion. Merchants dressed in holiday
silk and satin received their friends,
dispensing the usual annual gift which
makes tho children of the white folk
sick at slomach and head. Every
store was lighted and the. lanterns pf
green and yellow coloring, the bizarre
banners floating from the porches of
the houses and the twanging of string
Instruments were procf enough that
the annual festivities were on.
The morning and afternoon seemed
devoted to an airing of the native-born
Chinese. In strings and bunches, the
first, second and third bornâ some- .
times a fourth â paraded the streets to
