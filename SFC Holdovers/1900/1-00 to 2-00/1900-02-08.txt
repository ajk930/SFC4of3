"Corbett will agree to' fight In San Fran
cisco." said Cor.sidine. "provided the Na
tional Club will post a forfeit of $5000 with
AI Smith and allow Jim $siÂ» for expenses."
Brady said- ttat the conditions named
by the former champion's manager were
satisfactory, and that he would commu
nicate with the Golden Gate organization.'
"Now that we have selected the battle
ground," said Brady, "suppose we name
the referee."
"I am agreeable." said Considine.
"Whom do you name?"
In reply to which Brady asked. "Whom
do you want?"
Ccnsidine said that he favored "Tim"
Hurst. Brady studied a moment and said
his choice was "Charlie" White. Consi
dine said he would flrÂ«t have to consult
Corbett before agreeing on White for the
position in question.
"All right; any fair-minded man will
suit me," replied Brady. "If Jeffries was
fighting anybody but Corbett I would In
sist on George Slier as referee, as I think
he is thoroughly . honest and. competent,
but on account of the feeling between
Slier andCorbett I -will not Insist on Cor
bett accepting him for referee. 'Charley*
White. 'Bill* Naughton of San Francisco
or "Sam"- Austin will suit Jeffries."
Considine exacted a premise from Brady
to the effect that. Jeffries would not leave
for San- Francisco In advance of Corbett.
The former champion, who Is now at
Lake wood. N. J., Considine said, would
take his departure for San Rafael. Cal..
which will be' his training quarters, on
February IS- Jeffries, who Is now at Hot
Springs, will leave about the same time
for Los Angeles, where he will remain
until the fight takes place.
After the meeting Brady said that if
Corbett had not agreed to go to San
Franci3co and Insisted upon fighting at
Coney Island he would have declared the
contest off and arranged a match with
Sharkey. -
"If Corbett can get into good condition."
said Brady, "he will make an Interesting
bout with the champion."
PUGILISTIC CARNIVAL

fiercest yet experienced. There
was a continuous roaring all day
long. This morning it recom

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SAC
RAMENTO. Feb. 7.â Thomas
R. Bard is now California's
junior Senator. The crowning act which
makes him a representative of the State
at the national capital was performed at
noon to-day, when the Senate and As
sembly in joint session ratified their
work of the previous day. The mem
bers of both houses met in the Assem
bly chamber. A croxd of interested
spectators occupied the galleries and
elbowed for standing-room on the 2oor
and in the lobby. With lusty lungs they
joined with the law-makers in the dem
onstration of approval and pleasure that
followed the formal announcement that
Thomas R. Bard had' been chosen
United States Senator. The proceed
ings of the joint session were surround
ed with a degree of solemnity that im
pressed upon the members and the au
dience the importance of the task and
all that its faithful performance mear.t
to ths welfare of the Golden State and
the future in the West of the grand old
party of Lincoln and Garfield.
President (pro. tern.) Flint of the
Senate presided. Secretary Brandon of
the Senate and Chief Clerk Kyle of the
Assembly called the roll of their re
spective houses. Secretary Brandon
read the law governing the election of
United States Senators, and then read
that portion of the Senate journal re
cording the action taken by the upper
house the day before with relation to
the selection of a Senator. Chief Clerk
Kyle followed by reading the Senatorial
section of the Assembly journal. Ths
results were announced by President
Flint and Speaker 'Anderson, and ths
former then made the statement that
virtually prepared Thoma3 R. Bard for
the Senatorial toga. He said:
"It appearing from the reading of the
journals of the Senate and Assembly
that Thomas R. Bard has received a
majority of the vote 3 of the Senate and
Assembly for the oSce of Senator, I
hereby declare him elected to the ofsce
of United States Senator from the State
of California for the term of six years,
beginning March 4. 1599."
The announcement was greeted with
hearty applause. A committee, consist
ing of Senators Rowell and Leavitt and
Assemblymen Dibble and Radclis. wm
named by President Flint to escort Cal
ifornia's new Senator into the Assenoly
chamber. When the party marched up
the center aisle, with Senator Bard ana
in arm with Senator Rowell and As

blage arose to its feet and cheered. Mr.
Bard walked to the Speaker's desk,
where President Flint and Speaker An

hearty manner. When the applause
ceased President Flint introduced the
Venturan as "Senator Bard of Califor

the presentation. Through it all Sena

tiently awaited the opportunity to ex
press his thanks and his appreciation for
the honor that had been thrust upon
him. His remarks were brief and busi

guns opened at 7 in the morning
and a feint attack was made on
front of the British position.
Three battalions advanced toward
the Brakiontem with six oat
teries. At 11 o'clock the Boers
opened with artillery fire and sent
several shells among: the British
infantry, wtio retired one hour
later.
Meanwhile a vigorous attack
was marie on the extreme
right, where the engineers expe
ditiously constructed a position.
Several pieces of cannon, hidden
among the trees on Zwarts Kop,
bombarded heavily. The British
ir.fantrv advanced and the Boers
were entirely surprised.
At 4 o'clock a high hill, a con
tinuation of the Brakfontein. had
been taken. The operations were
excellently planned. The name
of the hill taken is Krantzkloof.
The bombardment of the Boer
position was resumed this morn

pearing cannon from the high
Doorm Kloof Range, on the
right of the hill captured, but the
British shells exploded its maga
zine and the gun was put out of
action until late in the day.
Musketry fire was intermittent
until the afternoon, when the
Boers made a determined eftort
to retake the hill. Reinforce

Boers were repulsed and the
British advanced along the ridge.

Â£pÂ«cial Dispatch to The Call
NEW TORK, Feb. 7.â Aa predicted
In The. Call's dispatches last
night, San Francisco has been
selected as the battleground for
the heavy-weight championship
fight between Jeffries and Corbett.. The
selection Tras made at a meeetlng to-day
between William -A. Brady, who repre
sented Jeffries, [ and George Consldine,
who looked after Corbett's interests. The
date of the fight was changed from March
15 to AprillO. Corbett and Jeffries will
fight for T5 per cent of the gross re
ceipts and for a 75 per cent interest In all
pictures of the contest taken. The battle
will b*: held under the auspices, of the Na
tional Athletic Club of San Francisco,
whose officials will post to-morrow with
Al Smith a forfeit of J3OOO, which 13 to be
divided between the 'principals "in the
event of the club being unable to bring
the matter to a successful conclusion.
Corbett will be allowed $500 for traveling
expenses.
When Considine and Brady met to dis
cuss the place for holding the contest
Considine said: '
"I understand that. Jeff rles Is willing to
fight at Coney Island." . . . ;
Brady told Corbett's manager that he
had been misinformed as *to Jeffries' In
tention, and that under no circumstances
would the heavy-weight champion agree
to go to Coney Island.
"Well," said Considine; "Jeffries Is the
champion, and I suppose he has a right to
dictate terms.- Where do you want to
nght?" :.Â¦.-. , Â¦
Brady replied .that.' Inasmuch aa . the
National Athletic . Club of San Francisco
served its purpose In preventing the con
centration of the enemy at the crucial
point, the Eleventh Brigade fell back to
the river.
"In the course of the operation both
the infantry and the artillery had been
subjected to a severe shell fire. Yester
day (Tuesday), at 4 o'clock in the after
noon, the enemy, encouraged doubtless by
their success at Spion Kop, endeavored to
recapture the position taken by us at Vaal
Krantz. They were beaten back, how
ever, with loss.
"The work accomplished Â»O far has he<m
magnificently done. The shell and Maxim
fire poured in by the Boers has been ex
tremtly severe, but our losses are. com
paratively speaking, small. The Durham
Light Infantry took a few prisoners in
the course of their charge.
"The enemy, as usual, fought with the
utmost stubbornness. The British ma
neuvering and the accuracy of aim on the
part of the British artillery during the
fighting on j Monday were beyond praise.
There is not the slightest likelihood that
the Boers will Eucceed in dislodging us
from the positions we have gained, and
the prospects of the relief of Ladysmith
are decidedly hopeful."

While April 10 is named as the day for
the battle, the National Club has between
that day and April 2) in which to brine
it oft*. This option is granted to provide
against any possible emergency that my
arise.
The place of the battle In the city Is yet
to be definitely determined. The man
agers of the National Club have not vet
fettled in their minds which of three
places to chocse. Their choice rests
among the Sixteenth and Folsom street
grounds, the Mechanics' Pavilion and
the Battle of Manila building on Mar
ket street, near Eighth. It is probable
that the last named building will be
chosen, as the National Athletic Club ha 3
a sub-lease upon it. and estimates that
between 6000 and TOOO persons may safeiy
be seated in it. Wherever the fight may
be held, the prices of admission will be
J2. 13, 55 and JlO a seat.
In speaking of the matter last night J
Glbbs of the National Athletic Cluo raid
he knew nothing of kinetoscope privi
leges, but if thfy had been considered It
would necessarily follow that the flghr
would have to take place In the daytime
This can very readily be done by remov
ing the roof of the Battle of Manila build
ing, which has been put on in sections
There is a possibility, however, that If the
fight takes place during the day it may
be held at the Sixteenth-street grounds,
and the tournament which is in contem
plation could be concluded at night la
the panorama building. These are ques
tions, which are yet to be answered by the
management.
The problem Involved la the selection of
a referee is a nerious one. but Glbbs said
positively last night that Slier, to whom
Corbett has a settled aversion, will not
be chosen under any circumstances. Some
"Western manâ and there are many to
choose from â will be selected.
"I consider that this fight." said J. Glbbs
last night," "will give a tremendous Im
petus to sport on this coast. It will draw
the best sports of the country to this city.
It will circulate money and for a time, at
least, will hold the eyes of the sporting
world upon San Francisco. The racing
season will be at its height, and I don't
think that any of the objections that were
made to Carson can justly be applied to
this city.
"We Intend to make the event one to
be remembered and will begin at once
with our preparations. It Is very prob
able that the Battle of Manila buil-Ung
will be chosen and that we will have a
pugilistic tournament for a day and
night." Â¦'

The measure was before the Senate Com
mittee on Hospitals, Health and Quaran
tine earlier in the day. Governor Gage
was present and pleaded for the extraor
dinary power which he asked. His efforts
were without avail, however. In spite
of his representations the committee
unanimously decided to refuse him his
request, and to report the Governor's fa
vorite bill back with the recommendation
that it do not pass. It is said that Gover
nor Gage was very angry when informed
of this action, but his anger had no ef
fect upon the committee. Â¦
This afternoon the bill was unfavorably
reported by Senator Rowell, chairman of
the committee. It was immediately taken
up, and Senator Wolfe, to make the meas
ure a little more acceptable ,to the Sen
ate, offered amendments . to limit the
number of persons who -would be placed
in the Governor's power by the passage
of the bill, requiring charges to be made
in writing, and permitting those accused
to Introduce evidence In their defense. It
was on these amendments the debate
which followed waa on, and their defeat
meant the defeat of the Governor's bill.
Senator Rowell spoke against the
measure with a quiet force that carried
predate and thank you, the represen
tatives of the people of the State of
California, for the honor which you
have conferred upon me. I accept the
cf2.ee to which you have been pleased

God's help. I will discharge its du
ties faithfully to the best of my abil

ward â the commendation of the peo
ple cf this State. Honesty and indus
try are common and homely virtues,
and relying upon these I shall hope
to win that reward.
After the applause which followed
Senator Bard's speech had died away

Hon. Stephen M. White, Mr. Bard's
predecessor, one of the most glowing
tributes ever tendered a California

EUREKA, Feb. 7.â Two lives were lost
in a fire at the Humboldt Lodging-house
eprly this morning. Of twenty-five or
thirty other lodgers two were seriously
irjured and several others narrowly es
raped. The dead are Hugh Frasier. a
hostler, and Rose Eastman, a woman of j
i'l-fame. The injured are Mrs. May Rlg
1 y. whose back and ankle were sprained,
tnd John Lyon of Fortuna, who has a
broken leg.
The cause of the conflagration was the
upsetting of a kerosene lamp in a room
on the lower floor of the building. This
room was occuoied by a woman named
Oilie Bethel.
The flames gained rapid headway and
many of the occupants were forced to
jump from the upper story windows,
which resulted'in the injury of two. The
Grand Hotel and several, other buildings
were threatened for a time. Finally
after the flames had been extinguished
the bodies of a man and woman were
found. The latter. Rose Eastman, was
terribly burned, one-half of her body be
ing charred to the bone. The face wa-<
also burned, but was remarkably well
preserved as to features.
Frasier undoubtedly was suffocated, as
his body was scorched but little. Under
neath the corpse $200 in gold coin waa
found. The building, which was almost
a total loss, was owned JtÂ»y Mrs. Xi:
Ferris and occupied by Antone Silva.
At last reports the injured were resting
easily. Whether Mrs. Rigbie's injuries
will be attended with serious results la
yet a matter of uncertainty. The building
was Insured for $300. but the stock an<i
fixtures were uninsured. The total loÂ«s
will foot up to between $3000 and ?4000.

"Whereas, There has been presented to
the Senate of the United States for rati

"Whereas, The said convention doe 3 not

Senate resolutions thanking Almlra S.
Townsend for services rendered . Calif or-
conviction. He pointed out that as a
matter of policy not only the amendments
but the bill itself should be voted down.
The measure represented a vicious prin
ciple that could not be indorsed. The
Senator's line of argument was followed
by most of those who spoke after him.
Senator Sims pointed out the unreason
able features of the measure, condemning
it as unconstitutional and not in keeping
with the fundamental principle that no
man shall be punished until he be proved
guilty. Senator Gillette insisted that the
proposed amendments did not cover the
viciousness of the measure and stated that
the present law gives the executive all the
power that is necessary for the proper
performance of his duties. Senator More
house also spoke against the measure,
pointing out how unreasonable it was to
give the Governor the extraordinary
power for which he asked.
Senator "Wolfe closed the debate,
speaking strongly In favor of his amend
ments, but the Senate was almost to a
man against them, and they were voted
down. Senator Rowell then moved to
kill the bill for all time by striking 1 out
the enacting clause. His motion met with
general approval, and was carried by a
vote of 23 to 9.

ASSEMBLY TO TAKE
SIMILAR ACTION
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 7.â The Assembly
Judiciary Committee this afternoon met to
consider an Assembly companion bill to
the Senate measure giving the Governor
extraordinary power to remove from
office, which was killed in the Senate this
afternoon. As the Senators had done,
they agreed that it was a vicious meas
ure and will report back recommending
that it do not pass.
PALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 7.â As The Call
L predicted, Governor Gage's as
sault on the State patronage re
ceived its first setback this after
noon when the Senate, after a pro
longed debate, refused to pass the so
called lunacy bill. The vote was 23
against the bill and only 9 for it. During
the debate Senators Wolfe and Short
ridge, who spoke for the measure, were
forced to acknowledge that the Governor
wanted it passed and appealed to the
Senators to vote for it as a compliment
to the executive. If the bill had passed
it would have given the Governor the
power to remove any employe of the
State Insane asylums. The Senators who
voted against it claim they did so because
the proposed law was ridiculous on its
face, and they wanted to give the Gover
nor to understand most emphatically that
he was not to be vested with authority
to undo the work of the Commissioners
in charge of the State institutions.
To-day's vote is looked upon as a test
of the Governor's strength in the Sen
ate, and there is little doubt that his
other patronage propositions will meet a
similar fate to that of the lunacy bill.
By a Vote of 23 to 9 the Executive Is Denied the
Power to Summarily Remove Officials and
Employes of Asylums for the Insane.

REDMOND DENOUNCES
THE WAR AS UNJUST
Moves in the Commons for the
Recognition of the Indepen
dence of the Boers.
LONDON", Feb. ". â John Redmond.
rha!rro3n of the United Irish party, was
loudly cheered by all sections of the Irish
rnfimbPTs when he arose in the House of
Commons to-day to move an amendment
lo the address in reply to the speech from
the throne, representing that the time had
arrived to bring the war to a conclusion
on the basis of recognizing the inde
pendence of the Transvaal and the Orange
Free State. He said the Irish party ab
horred this war, and Intended so far as
possible to maintain the independence of
the republics, defended with so much
heroism.
Rrdmond admitted that when the em
pire was involved in complications a feel-
Ing of hope and satisfaction stirred the
majority of the Irish at home and abroad.
But, he continued, the sympathies of the
liisn would still have been pro-Boer, even
if England had not been concerned and
another power had attempted to act
the "bully and oppressor in South Af
rica."
"Englar.d to-day." added Redmond,
'Â¦stands not in splendid but In disgraceful
isolation. Turkey aione lending her coun
tenance."
While admitting that official expression
of hostility had not been heard in the
Vnited Staffs, "chiefly because America,
being engaged in the Philippine war. had
not her&elf felt in a position to rebuke
England as she would otherwise have
done." Redmond declared that the over
whelming opinion of leading American
â¢statesmen was hostile to Great Britain in
this war, and said the "unanimous disap-
proval of the world demonstrated that
the Â¦war was unjust, and It ought, there
fore, to be stopped." "Â¦"''Â¦
As to whether or not the prospects of
home rule were adversely affected by
the attitude of the Irish. Redmond said
hp thought IrHand had nothing to lose
and everything to pain by raising her
voice on the side of Justice and liberty.
Patrick Joseph Power, member for the
East Division of Watcrford County, sec
onded Redmond's amendment.
Timothy Healy. Irish Nationalist, dur
ing ihe course of a speech dwelling on the
IJritish defeats, said:
"Heretofore the Boers have had only
two fete days "in their calendarâDing
man's day and Majuba day. But England
has given them Buller's day. White's day,
Otitacre's day. Methuen's day. Yule's day
and Symons' day."
Loud and continued cries of "Shame"
greeted the reference to the dead general,
and Healy hastened to declare that he
had the greatest respect for the late Gen
eral Symons.
Healy, continuing, said the most pa
thetic incident of the war was the cor
respondence between General Symons and
General Joubert before General Symons'
death, and the only unworthy feature was
that the English turned their backs upon
their dying general.
Thomas W. Russell, a Liberal (opposed
to home rule) member for the South Di
vision of Tyrone, replying to Healy on
behalf of the Government, said there was
one day the Boers would never celebrate,
and thafwas the day on which the Brit
ish Parliament should surrender under
such ignoble condition* as in ISSI.
On a vote being ' taken Redmond's
amendment was rejected by 36S to 66. The
House then adjourned.

2CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Feb. 7.â
Major Grr.eral Elwell S. Otis will be de
tached from duty as Governor General of
the Philippines and as commander of the
Department of the Pacific immediately
after the arrival of the new Philippine
coir.Tr.is6lon and will be ordered to return
to the United States. This action will be
Jn compliance with wishes of General
Otis, who has Informed the War Depart
ment that he is in need of a respite. The
President believes General Otis can be re
lieved after the arrival of the commission
at Manila, late In April or early In May,
without detriment to the Interests of the
Government. He will be succeeded by
the senior officer In the Islands, probably
Major General Arthur Mac Arthur, who
will be subordinate to the new commis
sion, which will possess plenary powers
and will b*e responsible to the War De
partment.
The granting of such extensive author
ity to the new commission and its assign
ment to duty under the "War Department
mark important departures in the policy
of the Administration. Members of the
Schurman commission have complained
that they were handicapped in their work
by the necessity of subordinating their
action to the military. The decision to
place the Taft commission under the War
Department means that the archipelago
!s now considered domestic territory.
After the suppression of organized re
sistance on the part of tho natives, the
archipelago will be divided into four
grand military departments. Judge Taft,
ac chairman of the commission, will re
main in Manila, supreme head of the ar
chipelago, and will be to all Intents and
purposes governor, although he will not
have that title. The civil affairs of each
military department will be administered
by a commissioner, who Â¦will be in every
thing but name Governor of the territory
comprised In that district.
It is expected that the commission will
leave for Manila aboÂ«t April 1. Judge
Taft said to-day he did not expect to re
main in Manila more than two years.
"I am going there with my colleagues,"
he 6aid, "for the purpose of establishing
civil government in all parts of the Isl
ands. I would like to say that I know
nothing of the report that I am to be
Governor General of the Islands. I ex-
SALOON QUARREL LEADS
TO A STABBING AFFRAY
H. A. CARTER DANGEROUSLY
CUT BY G. LUCY.
Wouxded Han Lying in a Critical
Condition at the Hospital â Knife-
Wielder Is Captured.
H. A, Carter, a plpe-fltter, employed by
Messrs. Wyberg & Lawrence, was stabbed
in the groin last night by George Lucy, an
ex-prize fighter, and is now lying at the
Receiving Hospital in a critical condi
tion.
Carter and Lucy met in McDougald's
saloon, at the northeast corner of Sixth
and Folsom streets, early in the even
ing and both became engaged in a heated
argument This led to blows, but friends
separated the twq, and as both signilled
a desire to try conclusions they retired
with their companions to a vacant lot two
blocks away. TJjc men stripped to the
bun* and proceeded to pummel each other.
Carter's sledge-hammer blows proved
too much for Lucy and the latter resorted
to an action not countenanced in the
prize ring. Lucy suddenly pulled a knife
and made a violent lunpe at his oppo
nent and grazed his arm. He repeated the
foul move and the knife blade struck Car
ter in tho groin. Lucy was disarmed be
fore he could do further execution. Car
ter fell to the ground, and as he was
bleeding profusely he was hurriedly sent
to the Receiving Hospital. Doctors Put
nam and Croll worked over him for an
hour and gave it as their opinion that the
man might not survive the stabbing
Carter refused to make any statement
as to what led to the quarrel. He said
that if he died he would carry the secret
of the controversy to the grave, but if he
survived he would let the world know
what it was about.
Lucy was arrested at an early hour this
morning by Officer Riordan and will be
held pending the result of his victim"s In
juries.

BULLER'S FORCES AGAIN
BATTLE WITH THE BOERS
Continued From First Page.
Buller the attack on the Boer positions
was begun this morning by nearly the
whole of our batteriesâ seventy-two guns
-shelling the rl<3ges where the enemy
have their trenches and redoubts on the
Brakfonteln and the low crest facing
Potgicters Drift.
"The enemy suffered severely. Several
hills were smoking like volcanoes from
the effects of the bombardment, which set
on flre their Btores and the grass.
"While the third pontoon bridge was
being constructed under flre near Schlel
Drift the Eleventh Brigade, now under
the command of Colonel Wynne, made a
demonstration against the Brakfonteln
Ridge, marching across the meadows with
the support of seven batteries of artillery.
"At 11 o'clock the enemy opened with a
â¢heavy cannonade of shrapnel, common
shell and pompln shells, chiefly from
Spion Kop. This was accompanied by a
rattling musketry flre. Our gunners be
haved admirably and were as cool as If
upon parade.
"The demonstration having gained ef
fect, the real attack upon the Boer left
was delivered at 4 o'clock. The Durham
Light Infantry carried Vaal Krantz, the
key to the lower ridges, while General
Hildyard's J brigade assailed the higher
ridges. The general and his troops are
bivouacking upon the field of battle. Jn

losses are trifling."

WAR BALLOON A
USEFUL ADVANTAGE
SPEARMANS CAMP, Feb. 7.â The war
balloon has proved a most useful advan
tage, making ascents daily and getting in
formation as to the Boer positions. The
Boers directed a heavy shrapnel flre'ln
the endeavor to destroy the balloon ap
paratus.
The artillery behaved splendidly
throughout, ably covering the infantry re
tirement from the front, attacking in the
face of a heavy Boer shell flre.
It is said that the Boers suffered very
heavily, as their ambulances were hard
at work.
The Boer position consisted of a line of
kopjes, strongly intrenched, extending
three miles from Spion Kop and curving
sharply at the eastern end to the south,
about opposite Zwarts Kop, which is a
steep hill south of the Tugela that the
British occupied before the seizure of Pot
gieters Drift.
After the capture of Krantz Kloof the
heavy Boer flre prevented a further ad
vance Monday. The next morning the
Boers InSulged In long range shell flre,
but in the afternoon they made a vigor
ous attempt to .recapture the position.
Their assault was made upon the north
ern end of the kopje and at first It was
successful. Reinforcements were, how
ever, hurried up and the British recarried
the position at the point of the bayonet
and advanced along the ridge. As the
British have the larger force of troops,
the outlook is hopeful.
IMPORTANCE OF THE
BRITISH MOVEMENTS
LONDON, Feb. B.â This morning's news
from South Africa Is of greatest Impor
tance, showing, as It does, that the re
inforced. British columns are putting
themselves in motion and that a deter
mined, combined attack upon the Boers
Is apparently In progress. ,/Â¦â¢""
The significance of the telegram an
nouncing that Lord Roberts and Lord
Kitchener have departed from Cape Town
can only be appreciated when read In con
junction with the reports of movements
on the extreme flanks of the British line.
In Natal General Buller has again
crossed the Tugela, and, according to
latest accounts, was fighting his way to
the relief of Ladysmith and achieving
some success.
Far to the westward, on Methuen's left.
General Mac Donald is threatening the
flank of the Boer forces at Magersfon
tein by his position at Koodoosberg, on
Rict River. From this point he could
turn Cronje's position, and will naturally
attract the Boers toward him. Any
movement he may make" further west
ward will render it easier for Lord Meth
uen to^push forward on tho way to Klm
berley.
In the center of this wide field of war
Lord Roberts, it is thought, at least, feels
himself strong enough to push forward
and convert the defensive attitude which
the British have been maintaining into an
offensive movement directed at the heart
of the Orange Free State.
With a force which does not number far
short of 30,000 men he has commenced his
march upon Bloemfonteln. As to the di
rection of this advance, color Is given to
the report that It Is by way of Colesber*.
by the fact that French's recent vlÂ«slt to
Cape Town was for the purpose of urging
tho commander-ln-chlef to give him re-
inforcements, as he thought that he could
then overwhelm the Boers holding that
position. It is possible that Lord Roberts
may decide to leave General French in
front of the Boers there. and strike out
east from the railway at some point south
of Modder River. In this case Cronje's
army would be menaced in front by' Lord
Methuen and on one flank by General
Mac Donald and on another by Lord Rob
erts, and would be in great danger.
Returning to Buller's movement, he
seems to have had hard fighting from the
start. An agency telegram states that
his further advance was prevented by the
Boers' heavy flre from Spion Kop and
Doom Kloof, and that the British casual
ties amount to 250.
Dispatches from Boer sources say that
the British were beaten back at Pont
Drift, while the position seized by the
British. Krantz Kloof, Is of no importance.
Nevertheless, Bujler has thrust the point
of his wedge Into the Boer line. Instead
of threatening the center and Boer right
by trying a turning movement to the west
he has this time feinted at the center and
broken through on tho left or east of
Spion Kop.
, From Boer sources comes Information
that on Monday Ladysmith had a little
fighting on its own account, probably to
the southward, where the Boers would
naturally be In some strength about On
deobroek and Groblers Kloof.
If Buller's and White's forces converged
In this direction It would be a serious
matter for the Boers there. With the
Tugela behind them. White on their front
and part of Buller's force on their flank
they would be hemmed In, especially as
there Is every probability that a British
brigade Is watching the opportunity for
crossing to the northwest at Colenso and
that Lord Dundonald with, his mounted
men has g^jne to the westward, and tha
roads leading to passes will bo held by
them, thus cut.tln.er off any possible retreat
of the Boers iirect Into the Free State.
General Bufler'a army, as near as can
bo estimated, consists of twenty-four bat
talions of irrfantry, nlno squadrons of
cavalry, nlns 15-pounder batteries, a flve
lnch bowit/cer battery, seven-pounder
mountain boitery and about twenty-four
I naval guns. â¢
Deducting losses, the forca should total
26,000 regula rs and about TOO colonial
troops. The available field foreÂ© would bo
about 24.CCG men.

SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 7.â Last night San
Rafael's telephone wires quivered and
thrilled under the flute-like notes of a
prlma donna's voice. Harassed "central"
forgot her troubles and the calls of Im
patient subscribers In the rare delight of
a private lyric recital pouring througn
the medium of her ears into the receiver,
of a distant 'phone. Helen Merrill of
Tlvoli and Australian fame Is resting at
her home here, and it is to prevent her
vocal chords warping during her San
Rafael sojourn that she seeks this means
of exercising her lungs.
Alfred Blumenthal, a violin-playing
prodigy and friend of the lyric artiste, is
the fortunate Individual to whom these
telephonic warblings are transmitted,
and he draws music from his fiddle in re
sponse to her birdlike trills.
Unfortunately for the secrecy of these
musical transactions the line Miss Merrill
affects Is a party one. A staid subscriber
on taking down Mb receiver the other
evening was horrified to hear somebodyâ
apparently "central"â inform him that
"when he had no money he needn't come
around." "I paid my bill last month," he
shouted Indignantly: "who are you, any
how?" "I'm the warmest baby In the
bunch*' came the reply In a few moments.
The disgruntled citizen cut off and told
the neighbors that "central" was crazy.
The' 'phone warbling habit may become
general, in which case business will 'have

chants cool their heels while long

on acotmt of a slippery track on a heavy

FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 7.â So far
as the situation In the controversy
over the Governorship of Kentucky
Is concerned, there was practically
no change to-day. Governor Tay
lor has not yet affixed. "his, signature to
the Louisville agreement, 'and, although
the general opinion is that he will ulti
mately do so, the probabilities are that,
he will not sign It until some time to
morrow, if then. .
Governor Taylor refused* absolutely to
day to make any statement in regard to
his probable action in the matter, and
during most of the flay declined to re
ceive any callers except his legal advis
ers. It was announced early In the day
that some action might be expected after
a conference between Governor Taylor
and Judge Yost, Attorney Fairleigh, Gov
ernor Bradley and W. C. P. Breckinridge.
The last named three, however, did not
arrive In Frankfort during the day, and
this afternoon Governor Taylor sent tele
grams to Governor Bradley, Augustus E.
Wlllson, Judge Barr and Attorney Fair
leigh, asking them to come to. Frankfort
for a conference to-night.
Mr. Willson was the only one to arrive.
Shortly after 8 o'clock to-night he. In
company with Judge Yost and General
Dan Lindsay, called on the Governor and
immediately went into a conference with
him. Before going Into the conference
Judge Yost said It probably would be a
lengthy one, and that he did not expect
any action to be taken to-night. Up to
a late hour no announcement had been
made as to the result of the conference.
Every section of the Louisville agreement
was gone over carefully, but it is under
stood that the principal thing under dis
cussion was the section bearing upon the
passage of a new election law.
The repeal of the Goebel law is the one
thing most strongly desired by Governor
Taylor, and as the language of the Louis
ville agreement is considered by him alto
gether too vague as regards this matter,
it is considered possible that changes may
be made in the way of making the clause
more specific before Governor Taylor af
fixes his signature to the agreement. This,
of course, would Involve further delay,
as it would necessitate a further confer
ence between the Republican and Demo
cratio leaders who were Instrumental In
drawing up the agreement at Louisville.
Action of this kind, indeed, was intimated
by a prominent Republican to-day, al
though nothing either in confirmation or
denial could be procured at the executive
offices. 'z. _ , ,
Another cause for Governor Taylor's
delay In regard to the agreement is said
to be the cry of "victory" and "surren
der" sent up by the Democrats.
The agreement as presented to Governor
Taylor Is understood to be somewhat dif
ferent from the published abstracts, In
that the clause regarding the election law
and one or two other matters Is much
more specific than It Is generally under
stood to be. though not strong enough to
pult him. For this reason the rank and
file of the Republican party In the State
apparently believe there Is some founda
tion for the claims set up by the Demo
crats, and scores of telegrams have
poured" in upon Governor Taylor In the
past two days, urging him not to sign the
agreement, but to maintain his present
position and await further developments.
TAYLOR ASKED NOT
TO SIGN AGREEMENT
LOUISVILLE, Feb. 7.â The existence of

Much Damage Done in
Vancouver.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 7^-One dead
man and another who was picked up Just
before he had expired were brought to
the city to-night by the steamer Comox.
The two men, George Clarke, nearly 60
years old, and Charles Johnston, had a
terrible experience In the storm that
swept up the coast on Monday night.
They were In a fishing sloop and were
overturned at 8 o'clock on Monday night.
They succeeded in getting on top of the
boat and remained there all through the
night, being nearly swept off by the waves
several times. They were carried by the
wind into Desolation Bay, King Horn
Sound, and were not picked up by the
Comox until this morning, after they had
been on the boat for nfty-slx hours with
out food or drink. The old man's suffer
ings were terrible. He went practically
Insane early on Tuesday and gradually
succumbed.
On Tuesday evening the steamer passed
near them on her way north. They hailed
the boat In the darkness, but did not
make themselves heard and they stayed
there the whole of another night. Clark*
wept like a child when the steamer passed
without taking, them on board. On Tues
day afternoon Johnston tried to swim
ashore, but the surf was too rough and
the poor fellow had to awlm back to the
boat and Just had strength to pull himself
aboard again. An hour before the Comox
found them this morning Clarke died.
The other man pulled the body further
up on the boat and held on to It until
the steamer showed up. He was too weak
to move and had to be lifted on board.
The dead man was an Eastern Canadian
and a well-known logger.
In the city of Vancouver much damage
was done, but no lives were lost. The
wind, which became almost a cyclone, at
tained a velocity of fifty-five miles an
hour. Along the water front the waves
broke over the wharves and bridges,
sweeping away boathouses, wrecking
boats and dashing two steam launches
against the pier, batting the craft into
total wrecks. Two stone-laden scows
went adrift and were wrecked, and two
steamers broke their moorings and were
brought to their docks with great diffi
culty. Telephone wires In the suburbs
are down and the long distance system
is completely paralyzed.
Trees were torn up by the roots, flagstaffs
and chimneys fell and a cottage on the
Westminster road was crushed like an
egg shell by a gigantic tree which was
blown down and fell on the roof. Though
there were three occupants tn the house
at the time, all escaped Injury. The
damage to residences, factories, wharves
and shipping will aggregate many
thousands of dollars.

The last named was said to be out or tna
city. The others left on an afternoon
train for Frankfort. They would not talk
of the negotiations, not being advised as
to the particular points Governor Taylor
wished to discuss with them.
The Republicans of this city are not
agreed as to the wisdom of aloslng tne
negotiations on the basis of the agree
ment reached Tuesday night Postmaster
Baker and some other Federal officers
think the sacrifice should be made in
the interest- of peace, while the press and
the anti-administration faction of. the
city believe the fight should be kept up.
The latter, or Davis faction, held a meet
ing to-night, at which resolutions were
adopted urging Governor Taylor not to
sign the agreement. *
John Marshall. Republican Lieutenant
Governor, said this afternoon that _bo
many protests were being made by Â«e

When the committee on arrangements
met this afternoon there was considerable
debate as to whether It was advisable for
the funeral .procession to pass the capl
tol grounds, where the soldiers are en
camped and in which the dead man was
shot down. Some members of the commit
tee were fearful that In the excited state
of feeling that existed some partisan in
the procession would allow his feelings to
override his Judgment and fire a shoj. or
two into- the capitol grounds and create
trouble. Others were strongly in favor of
having the parade take the route that
would require it to march past the cap

dlsusslon, but It was finally decided that
the march past the capitol grounds
should be made and the route was bo ar

WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â Walter M.

Mr. Woods by Ector he returned it to.
Clark.
Blckford explained the purchase of
timber land owned by Representative Mo-
Laughlin prior to the meeting of the Leg
islature. He contended that the property
was worth more than had been paid for it
and that the timber was necessary in
Clark's business. In his deal with Mc-
Laughlin the .witness had never talked
with him concerning the Senatorial situa
tion nor tried to influence him In that
connection to vote for Clark. â¢
On his cross-examination Blckford said
that he was counsel for Clark, but after
saying that he would not tell what his fees
had been, he said that all told Clark had
paid him $2500 as counsel. He said Wil-,
flam McDermott had refunded to him the
money expended in the campaign and he
thought McDermott was engaged In
Clark's interest.
During the day the committee formally
declined for the present to allow the de
fense to go Into the campaign of 1893.
TAYLOR NOT YET
READY TO YIELD
URGES MEDIATION
TO END THE WAR
Speech of Shafroth in
the House.
Â»
WASHINGTON. Feb. 7.â The House
finished the diplomatic and consular bill,
passing It substantially as it came from
the committee. There was some desultory
discussion of the Philippine question and
the war in South Africa, the principal
feature Leiue the speech of Shafroth In
favor of mediation in the British-Boer
Â¦car under the provisions of The Hague
treaty. The diplomatic bill as passed car
ries i3.T43.iWS. <â¢.
Shafroth declared that under The Hajue
treaty Knpiand could not consider an offer
of mediauon an unfriendly act. In reply
to questions he insisted that the South
African republic was an independent Gov
ernment, notwithstanding Great Britain's
claim of suzerainty. While the British
were demanding relief in the South Afri
can republic, he said, 3000 Dutch residents
of British Guiana, born upon British soil,
who are not allowed to hold official posi
tions In the executive or judicial branches
of the colonial government, were petition
ing for relief. Their cases were almost
analogous to those of the UHlanders in
the Transvaal, yet Great Britain refused
to listen to the Dutch in her own colony.
Shafroth said he did not advocate armed
intervention or even mediation, but only
the tender of our good offices under sec- ,
t!on 3 of The Hague treaty.
Grosvenor of Ohio replied briefly to Sha
troth, saying that the ratifications of The
Hague treaty have not been exchanged.
He said he sympathized with any people ;
struggling for liberty. He set the House
Into a roar with the suggestion that a
committee of twentv-flve members at sal
aries of Â£10.000 each be appointed to roam
over the earth to discover where wrongs
have been committed and to report to tbw
House in order that the United States
might go to war every time the kin of any
of our constituents were oppressed.
William Alden Smith of Michigan said
he w<is. nÂ«t- authorized to spealc for the
administration, but he knew that if our
Government were asked to act by either
-party* to -the conflict It 6 kindly offices
would be willingly placed at their dis
posal. He did not state that such offer
ha<l been made.
Gillett of Massachusetts defined his po
sition relative to the Philippines, declar
ing that, in his opinion, the "natives of the
ls!ar..is were not lit for self-government
c.nd would not b<Â» within his lifetime, and
that as they had come to us by treaty
the only question now open was. How
chall we govern them?

PORTO RICAN TARIFF BILL.
Republican Committeemen Not Unan
imous for the Measure.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.-r-It . developed
to-day in connection with the Porto Rico
tariff bill that the majority of the Ways
Bnd Means Committee was not unani
mous for the measure or for the principle
it involved as to the government of terri
torial acquisitions, and that Representa
tive McCalL Republican member of the
committee from Massachusetts, had rre
f rnted a strong dissenting report. Vi hen
the Ways and Means Committee passed
on the bill last week McCall withheld liis
vote the understanding being that he had
not yet given that careful study to the
issues involved necessary to permit him
to vote either way. In other respects the
vote was on party lines, all Republicans
except McCall \oting for the bill, and all
the Democrats against it. The Ways an l
Means Committee at Its meeting to-day
reached a decision that the debate on tne
Porto Rico tariff bill should begin on the
6th and last one week.
ELECTION OF SENATORS.
Miaority Report on the Bill Pre
sented in the House.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 7.â A minority re
port has been made to the House on the
bill for the election of Senators by the
people. It concurs with the principle of
the bill, but urges direct election without
awaiting legislative approval for a
change of system, as proposed by the ma
jority- The report Btates that there is
widespread public demand for the election
of Senators, in part impelled by a "senee
of righteous indignation aroused by ac
cusations of alleged methods sometimes
employed by gentlemen whose ambitions
l^ad them to seek a seat in the United
States Senate."
Under f=uch circumstances Rucker and
Ze'.gler. who sign the report, say the time
has come when the exalted position of
United States Senator shall not be open
to the suspicion of being purchasable.
For a Buffalo Reservation.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â The House
Committee on Public Lands to-day acted
favorably on a bill by Representative
Mondell allowing a second homestead to
one who has committed or has lost his
homestead without a rellnqulshment for
value. The committee also heard Colonel
"Buffalo" Jones In favor of the bill for a
buffalo reservation In New Mexico. He
Ftated that the American buffalo was al
most extinct, the entire number the world
ni'Â«r *i*>lr<ir nhoiit 20! l or 400.

MOLINEUX CASE
NEARING AN END
Expected to Go to the
Jury To-Day.
NEW TORK. Feb. 7.â Barlow a Weeks
to-day concluded hia summing op of tha
defense In the trial Â«f Roland B. Molineux,
charged with the murder of Mrs. Kath
erlne J. Adams by poison sent to Harry
Cornish. Assistant District Attorney Os
borne began the argument for the prose
cution and had not finished when court
adjourned until to-morrow, whan It la ex
pected the case will go to the jury-
Weeks continued bis analysis of the tes
timony Introduced, declaring that part of
It waa falsehood and that the prosecution
had utterly failed to prove a motive, lie
took up the relations of Mollneux and
Cornish and asserted that there was no
proof of malice toward Cornish on the
defendant's part. Weeks to-day did not
repeat his attack on Cornish.
Osborne at the outset of the argument
stated that Cornish's connection with tno
case was thoroughly looked into at the
start, before any arrest was made, and
that Cornish was put through a most
searching examination.
ThÂ© allegation that one of the Jurors
had said that "he would not hang a doff
on such evidence" was Investigated to
day and found to be without basis.
Mollneux's father, mother and wife were
In court all day. The prisoner's wife wept

DEPEW CLASHES
WITH PETTIGREW
Tilt Over the Philippine
Question.
WASHINGTON*. Feb. 7.â A lively tilt
between Depew (R.) of New York and
Pettlgrew (Silver R.) of South Dakota
was the feature In the early proceedings
of the Senate to-day. Depew read a letter
from President Schurman of the Philip
pine Commission flatly contradicting
statements made by Pettlgrew In a
speech several days ago, and commenting
sarcastically upon the methods of the
South Dakota Senator in Introducing the
evidence of such men as President Schur
man and Admiral Dewey through the
statements of Agulnaldo. Pettigrew re
plied, sharply repeating much that he has
said heretofore, but principally reiterating
the statements which had called forth the
denials of both President Schurman and
Admiral Dewey. Said he:
I chare-* that the facts of this Question are
being withheld and that what Information is
sent to us ls garbled, and I also charge that
we attacked an ally and made a compact with
slavery.
It Is well known that this Government,
through the Philippine Commission, offered
money for the rifle's of the Insurgents, but no
rifles were turned In except a lew that had
been captured and ffiven to friendly Filipinos
by American officers In order that they may
be turned in so as to tret the price offered for
them. It la quite as well known that the
Schurman commission offered Aguinaldo what
amounted to $3CCO a year If he would lay down
his arms.
Pettlgrew thought It unfortunate for
the administration that the whole of Ad
miral Dewey's letter to Senator Lodge
had been published, as In It the admiral,
he said, had admitted just what he had
charged.
Hoar of Massachusetts asked Depew If
he had understood that President achur
man did not regard Aguinaldo as honest.
He had read a verbatim address of Presi
dent Schurman In which he had said
Agulnaldo was honest.
Depew replied that he had no further In
formation than was contained In Presi
dent Schurman's letter.
It was the Intention of Chandler, chair
man of the Committee on Privileges and
Elections, to call up the Quay case to
day, but he yielded to the unanimous con
sent agreement to take up the pending
financial bill, simply announcing that dur
ing any lull In the financial debate he
would bring the Pennsylvania Senatorial
case before the Senate.
Turner of Washington then entered upon
a discussion of the financial bill. He
maintained that the passage of the pend
ing bill would be a deliberate blow to sil
ver. The bill was put forward, he said,
by the Republican party In the Interests
of the moneyed 'class. Its result would
be the enhancement of the value of things
produced by the farmers and laboring
classes.
Bate of Tennessee followed In a speech
In favor of bimetallism and In opposition
to the proposed gold standard.
THIS OFFICES WAS GAME.
Wounded Four Times He Snatches
Victory From an Ambuscade.
Among the soldiers brought home by the
transport Sherman is one now staying at
the Occidental whose record is one of
which he has just cause to be proud if
what his comrades say of him is true.
This gentk-man, like all brave men. is
modest and will not talk of his own ex
ploits, but his friends are doing it for him, 1
and consequently it is impossicle for him j
to kc-Â«p nis Uifht under a bushel.
The soldier in question is Lieutenant t .
M. Ferguson of the Thirty-sixth United
Stale* Volunteer Infantry. At the out
break of the war with Spain Lieutenant
Ferguson went to the front with tun
stcn s Kansas fighters. When the volun
teers were about to be sent home he was
given a commission in the Thirty-sixth
as a recognition of the bravery with
which he had led his men while with the ;
boys from Kansas.
Shortly after assuming his duties with
his new" command Lieutenant Ferguson,
while loading a scouting party consisting
of twenty-one men. was ambushed by the
Insurgents. One volley was fired into tha
littie party, which killed two of them and
wounded eight others. Ferguson was hit
four times by this one volley. Two fin
gers v.tre taken off his left hand by two
bullets; while a couple more of the leaden
pellets found lodgment in his body. Not
withstanding his hurts the brave officer
continued to command his men until the
entmy had been rtar.ked and the surprise
turned into a victory for the American
troops.
Lieutenant Ferguson has been sent
home on eick leave to recuperate from
his (rounds and the effects 01 the Philip
pine climate. He ls anxious for more
adventure, however, and will return to the
firing line as ?oon as he can obtain thÂ«
permission of his superiors.

NEWSBOYS BURY ONE
OF THEIR COMPANIONS
WARM hearts beat in the breasts of the newsboys of this city. Out
of their small earnings each day they are always willing to assist
any of their number that is laid low by illness.
Sunday last James Davis, a bright newsboy, died at the City
and County Hospital, and his young co-workers immediately set
about to see that he received a proper burial. Subscription lists were start
ed, and within a short time the names of many young newspaper venders
were attached thereto, and beside each name were sums aggregating from 25
cents to to. The body was removed to the undertaking parlors of McGinn
Brothers and placed In a neat coffin.
The funeral was held yesterday afternoon from the undertaking parlors,
and nearly thirty of the generous lads, some with papers under their arms,
congregated in the parlors, and after taking a last look at Davis six of them
carried the remains to the waiting hearse. Out of the money collected three
carriages were engaged at half rates, and six boys crowded In each vehicle
and followed the deceased to the grave. A number of simple floral pieces
were placed on the grave and the mourners hurriedly returned to the city to
take up their daily occupation of selling newspapers.
Appended to the subscription lists were the following names: "Fatty"

VORS THE ORDER.
New Measure to Be Drafted Compel
ling Company to Collect Nickel
After Party Called For
Answers.
The Supervisors' License and Orders
Committee decided yesterday to recom
mend the passage of an order similar to
that adopted by the last board and vetoed
by the Mayor, making it a misdemeanor
for an individual or company furnishing
telephone service to collect for it until the
party called for answers. Chairman
Com'te and Supervisors Booth and Mc-
Carthy were present at the meeting and
expressed themselves as being heartily
In favor of putting an end to the exac
tions of the telephone company In collect-
Ing the nickels of the public for defective
service. ? " 1,
The question came up on the Mayor s
veto of the original order Imposing a tine
of $SOO and imprisonment' for three months
for each violation of the provisions of the
order. The committee was unanimous in
its opinion that the, order was good and
necessary legislation, but as all Incom
plete acts of the old board are nullified
under the terms ot the charter It was
found necessary to sustain the Mayor's
veto and to direct Clerk Russell to draw
up a new order on lines exactly similar to
the old one and recommend it for passage
at the next meeting of the board.
Superintendent Hewitt, who has In
quired Into the subject, informed the
board that he was not quite clear In his
mind as to the claim made by the com
pany that it would be necessary to In
crease the number of wires and the num
ber of its operators should the order be
passed. Supervisor McCarthy was of the
opinion that the company should give
some more definite reason why the order
should not be passed, and said he for one
was of the firm opinion that the abuses
cf the nickel telephone attachments
should cease.
An ordinance will also be recommended
for passage transferring the power of
granting free licenses from the License to
the Chanties and Correction Committee.
The question of repealing that portion
of an order licensing nlckel-In-the-slot
card machines was postponed for a week
for further investigation. The committee
was informed by Deputy License Collector
Casey that such machines pay $12,000 per
annum into the city's coffers, and the
committee hesitated about abolishing that
revenue. It was also, decided to license
other privileges which now escape taxa
tion. MiWS

ALWAYS FOR PROGRESS.
Catholic Truth Society Listens to
Some Church History.
St. Mary's Cathedral was crowded last
r.ight with the members of the Catholic
Truth Society and its friends, who as
eembled to hear the Rev. Father Ryan
cpeak on the historical aspect of the Ro
man Catholic church. The speaker is the
spiritual adviser of the League of the
Cress, ar.4 hundreds cf the members of
that organization were present.
The lecturer reviewed briefly the atti
tude cf the church from the earliest times
and showed how it had always been the
faithful friend of education, of civiliza
tion and of all that the world calls pro
gress. It is absurd at this time, said the
speaker, to attempt to belittle the work
cf the church when all history tended to
prove that the teachings of the church
were, in all ages, the standards upon
which modem civilization had been built.
Father Ryan extolled the work of the
Catholic Truth Society and kindred organ
izations, and said that without their aid
the regular work of the church would be
materially handicapped.

ILLUSIONS ARE NATURAL.
Professor Stratton Hopes to Find
Them in the Next World.
"Illusions" was the subject of Professor
Stratton's 'lecture before the San Fran
cisco Polyclinic last night. Under the
professor's novel way of handling the
subject the common illusions of life are
such no longer in the ordinary accepta
tion of the term. They can be under
stood, provided for, and become useful
factors in the human economy.
With the aid of many diagrams Profes
sor Stratton demonstrated the statement
that although the mind frequently ls con
vinced by unmistakable proof that It ls
facing an Illusion it cannot destroy the
illusion, even In the face of fact. This is
one of the great uses of illusions, and
gives them a positive scientific value. The
normal mind can study and be greatly
benefited by Its illusions and the psychol
ogist can explain many apparent hallu
cinations that perplex the ordinary mind.
It is only when the mind has become
so warped by clinging to its Illusions

Pearl and May de Meir, Who Will Make Their Debut at the Olympia.
t- ii Â¦iMV'O young and pretty San Francisco girls will make their debut as professional vaudeville artists at the Olympia
next Monday night. Pearl and May de Melr are the names of the two latest aspirants for stage honors, and it
]Â£ will be owing to no lack of talent for the work If they fall to win success. Both girls have appeared before
San Francisco audiences on numerous occasions, but always as amateurs, and they have Invariably been ac
corded a flattering reception. Their specialties are coon songs and dances, but their engagement calls for all-around
vaudeville work. With youth, good looks and genuine ability as singers and dancers, combined with attractive per
sonality, the De Meir sisters have every element that goes to make success in their chosen profession, and their
friends are confident that the public will not be slow in recognizing their merits.
CAUGHT GHOST
IN A TRAP
He did not have to wait so long, how
ever. In about thirty minutes he heard
the trap spring and going to the place he
had set it, found that it ha.d caught a
large coon that had been making its home
between the upper ceiling and the rafters.
Stanton brought his prize to Easton,
Eldridge & Co., and was rewarded with
$20 and the possession of the coon.

Manila Hero Wins $20
and Reputation.
The Fifth street ghost, which so long
disturbed the tenants of the mansion situ
ated at No. 145 on that thoroughfare, has
been discovered and "Boy" Stanton, one
of the blood-bespattered heroes of the
"Fighting First," is the happy possessor
of a twenty-dollar piece and a reputation
for fearlessness that has made him the
admired and beloved of all the demoiselles
south of the bitumen to whom his feat is
known.
The building at 146 Fifth street belongs
to Easton, Eldridge & Co., or at least
they have the management of It. Some
time ago the trouble began, when the
tenants threw up their lease and vacated,
saying that the place wa^ haunted and
that they did not care to associate with
ghosts of whose social standing they
knew nothing, and who came and went at
will through all the hours of the night
without references or anything else to
guarantee their respectability.
Other tenants were secured, but. after
remaining a few days, they invariably
moved out, declaring that there was
something wrong with the building;
something uncanny; something they
could not explain, but which manifested
Its presence by weird rapplngs, horrid
moans and growlings and other strange
and fearsome noises commonly supposed
to be the exclusive property of the deni
zens of the other world.
Easton. Eldridge & Co. were worried.
The house was a valuable piece of prop
erty, situated in the very heart or the
city and before the advent of the "ghost"
it brought In a rental that was more than
satisfactory to its owners and the agents.
They tried to hire men to investigate, but
the terror of the place had spread and
no one could be had for love or money
to monkey with the nocturnal visitor or
visitor?. That was the state of the case
up till yesterday, when '"Boy" Stanton
appeared en the scene.
"Bey" was Just in from the country
and had been celebrating. He wandered
down In the vicinity of No. 146 and was
told of the ghost.
"Ghosts!" said the "Boy." "T'll with
the ghost. I've helped make 'em In the
old days when I was wid Duboce before
Manila. Whose dis guy dat wants to pay
for de capcher of dis partlc'lar bird?"
Stanton was told the proper persons to
apply to and started off. returning In a
few hours with a bear trap, a bottle of
whisky and a Springfield rifle. He en
tered the house, set and baited the trap
and started to watch through the night.

TWO PRETTY SAN FRANCISCO
GIRLS GOING INTO VAUDEVILLE
TROUBLE DUE TO
A LITTLE PLUG
OF SOFT METAL
Secret of Manauense
"Disaster."
SAFETY DEVICE BLOWN OUT
â¢
LEAK ES" THE VESSEL'S BOILERS
EXPLAINED.
Exports of the Accident Say She Was
Forced Until the Plug "Went
and Then Steam Could
Not Be Raised.
A board of inquiry will be ordered in
the Manauer.se and within a few days
the ecandal that has been thrown around
her will be cleared up. The Manauense
is the transport that, carrying a portion
of the Thirty-first Infantry, under Lieu
tenant Colonel Hayes, to Manila, broke
down, the accident giving rise to a sen^a
tlor.al report from Hayes and a claim that
he and his men sa% - ed the ship from sir.k
ing. He also reported that after some
Elight repairs were made the ilar.aue:;?e
overhauled the Peking. her conso- 1.
against which vessel there was no cora
piaint.
The Quarterraaster^s department h*iÂ»
been investigating and secrecy has been
enjoined on ail concerned, but it is prci:y
well understood that a fusible plug in
one of the boilers caused all the trouiile.
A fusible plug is a safety device tliat
Is in use en all vessels that carry passen
gers. It is a plug of an alloy of metals
that will melt at low temperatures, the
temperature at which it raeits being mod
erated by the mixture of the alloy. The
pressure of steam ar.d its temperature
are always in a certain ratio, one to the
ether, ar.d so when the safety limit ol a
boiler is known, the temperature of that
pressure is also known, ar.d a fusible
plug made to melt at that temperature
will always give way when it is reachel.
A boiler will blow off through its safety
valve before it reaches the pressure that
will melt the plug, but if the safety valve
fails to work cr is overlaoded the plug
will go first. This is what happened on
the Mer.auer.?e. according to the bÂ«^t re
ports, and is all there is to the "disas
ter."
Fcr some time before the accident hap
pened the men pay Hayes was forcing tl'e
vessel. He could only have done that by
ordering .an increase in the steam press
ure. It made the work harder in the fire
rocms, an<3 to keep the men up they wore
given whisky until the force was practi
cally demoralized. It was then that the
accident happened. The boilers began to
leak, and for three days the firerocm
force hunted for the leak. They finally
found that one of the plugs, about *n
inch in diameter, had melted out or been
blown out cf one of the boilers. It was
in behind the bciler and hard to get at.
even with the bciler cold, and that was
what caused the delay.
From the time the plug blew out the
leak was apparent, and all the time the
men were trying to find it cold water
had to be continually pumped into the
boilers to supply the place of that run
ning out. for which reason the men rould
not raise steam. When the plug hole was
closed there was no more trouble, and. as
appears In Hayes" report, he came up
with the Peking, which was a day ahead
of him.
It Is declared that the llanauer.se nÂ»Â»
rot had a bit of repair work done on
her since the accident, beyond the re
placing of the plug, end yet she ~arre
back from Manila at 13 knots, and there
Â¦was not the least trouble with her ma
chinery. It is believed that in forcing- the
vessel "the steam was raised hiph enough
to mÂ«!t the tenderest of the fusible pluars.
ar.d the trouble was over the location of
the leakâ not ar.y defect in the ship's con
dition.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1900. Ii
SOME TEACHERS
FAILED TO GET
BACK SALARIES
Demands Are Lost by
Carelessness.
Â«
BOARD IS TO INVESTIGATE
?
FOUR EMPLOYES PLACED ON
T7NASSIGNED LIST.
Several Resignations Accepted â Sub
stitutes to Beceive $2 50 a
Day When Actually
Teaching.
The Board of Education was informed
at yesterday's meeting by Superintendent
Webster that he had received several
complaints from teachers who allege that
they had not received their demands call
ing for 61 per cent of their salar
ies for November, 1398. These demands
were recently ordered partially paid out
of moneys received from collateral inher
itance taxes. Mr. Webster stated that
Miss Lucy Wores, who taught in the
Washington Grammar School at the time,
and. E. L. Kilpatrick. principal of the
Business Evening School, were among
those who had suffered owing to the de
mands having beer, lost or overlooked.
He asked that the matter be Investigated.
The board immediately directed Secre
tary Hanson to ascertain where the
blame lies. It developed that there were
a number of other teachers who failed
to get the 61 per cent of their November
salaries. Secretary Hanson acknowl
edges that there were about a dozen
lost demands, but it is believed that the
number will reach twenty, aggregating
$1500 or more.
The Auditor says there is absolutely
no remedy for the error unless the money
is paid out of other moneys received as in
heritance taxes. He says that the demands
were sent intact from his office, where
they had lain since November. 1533. to
the board to be changed to the 61 per
cent basis. Whether the demands were
lost In transit he is unable to tell, but the
fact that a rigid investigation has been
ordered by the board is evidence that the
matter is deemed of considerable im
portance.
Director Denman expressed himself as
opposed to the indiscriminate granting
of leaves of absence. He claimed that
the placing of classes in charge of
strangers impairs the discipline and effl
ciency of schools. Miss Nora Sullivan
was granted a six months" leave, while
M. H. Slavan's application for an ex
tension was denied. Superintendent
Webster will act on Margaret Curry's
application. .
The board, on the request of Secretary
Moran of the Civil Service Commission,
tendered that body the use of the audi
torium of the Girls' High School for the
examination to be held on March 1.
A resolution was adopted providing
that all teachers elected or promoted to
higher positions in the School Department
shall be so selected on probation for
three years. I_ "

and Margaret A. Fennell of the Hancock.

standpoint of party principle and policy.
KASSON IS ANGRY.
IT is reported that Mr. Kasson, American Com
missioner of Reciprocity, is angry at the opposi
tion to his Jamaican and French treaties. This is
sad. He proposed to trade off the interests of Cali
fornia in order to open a French market for American
kerosene. The profit on that market under his ar
rangement is to be taken out of California producers
of fruit, and wine, and brandy. It strikes a reason
able man that California should be angry, and Mr.
Kasson should be apologetic.
His Jamaican treaty is taken as the measure of
freedom to be given in our markets to the products
of Cuba and Porto Rico. He is just now reinforced
by General Roy Stone, whose professional specialty
has been regarded to be the construction of good
roads, but who now appears as a specialist in re
ciprocity, second only to Commissioner Kasson him
self. We fear that the General is also angry. He an
nounces that heretofore he has stood by protection
to American labor through thick and thin, and, ad
mitting that one-half of the people in the West In
dian islands live on 5 cents a day, declares that fact
is urged as an objection to Mr. Kasson's reciprocal
arrangements only by stupid people!
The California orange-grower, who, from San
Diego to Shasta, can go into the market with his
splendid product nearly every day in the year, and
who has made oranges as cheap as apples used to be,
may be stupid, but when his labor costs from a dol
lar to a dollar and a half a day, he is just stupid
enough to remark that he cannot compete with labor
that fattens on 5 cents a day.
General Stone says that he wants the American
workman to have an orange. If he will study the
American workman and be wise he will find him al
ready in possession of several oranges, cheaper than
he ever had them before, and able to get them by re
ceiving wages held up to the American standard by
protection against labor that lives on 5 cents a day.
We have assumed that the Kasson treaties would be
beaten. They should be defeated as an economic
proposition. The California members of Congress
should devote themselves to their defeat. Turning
from economics to politics, and in this issue the two
are inseparable, we wish to ask Republican leaders
what argument they, can make for protection if these
treaties are ratified, and General Stone's airy remarks
about 5 cents a day labor are used in the campaign?
As Mr. Kasson has treated the Dingley bill as a
measure passed for the sole purpose of forcing other
nations into reciprocal free trade, General Stone
admires cheao labor in the tropics^ it will occur to
those matters in which he Is bo deeply
Interested. In the evening Mr. Otani was
given a dinner at the Pacific Union Club,
after which he became the guest of Mr.
Newhall at a theater party.
Accompanying Mr. Otani in the capacity
of secretaries are T. Mlzutany of Toklo
and K. Ward of Yokohama.
It is thought by those interested In the
establishment of a local commercial mu
seum that the arrival of Mr. Otani is most
opportune, as his Influence, if exerted in
the Interests of the project, will have
great weight in the Orient and will do
much toward facilitating: the plans of tho

Mr. Otani will remain in the city but a
few days, as it is his intention to take

A DAILY HINT FROM PARIS.
ALL men not in politics, and all men in politics, in California, know that no election
of a Senator was ever as free and stainless of bargain, bribery, barter and indirec
tion as Bard's.
The Examiner began its course of slander of him by saying that he is "rich but
respectable." Did it lie about his respectability or is its code of respectability consist
ent with the commission of the crime of bribery to get a great office, or with becoming
the conscious beneficiary of bribery by others?
Senator Bard is in comfortable circumstances, thanks to his own exertions as boy
and man, and the slauders of the Examiner will not tarnish his respectability. Califor
nia has had rich Senators. Several of them have been Democrats. The Call has no
desire to go beyond epitaphs to discuss their respectability, or add to existing public
knowledge of the means by which they reached the Senate. But personal reputation
does not wait for death to make it dear to the friends and the family of a public man,
and that of Senator Bard is as precious to his household, his partisans and his compan
ions, now while he il alive, as that of some of his not remote predecessors is, though they
have passed on.
Â¦ The Examiner is the last paper that should discuss such a subject offensively,
and the last that should wildly and wickedly lie to defame an honest man, who has won
a Senatorship by honest means, for between him and others there is a contrast that* in
stinctively occurs to every man who is familiar with the history of California politics for
the past score of years.
Assuming that its readers are fools, the Examiner proceeds to enlarge upon- its
single count against Senator Bard, that he is rich, and represents him as the choice and
minion and puppet of Mr. C. P. Huntington, and then in the same issue charges that
he was elected by the expenditure of $100,000 by the Sugar Trust.
As a study in the evolution of a lie the Examiner's defamatory attack is a model.
Its several steps are as follows:

THE CHRONICLE'S IDEAS.
THE Chronicle appears as the warm proponent
of free trade with the tropics. It affects to see
no difference between free trade between lowa
and Minnesota and the same condition with Porto
Rico, Hawaii and the Philippines.
We are ready to admit that there would be no dif
ference if "the flag" could give the axis of the earth
a different angle to the plane of its orbit, thereby
shifting the vertical sun and changing the climate.
The difficulty is a physical difference between the
temperate zone and the tropics. In our continental
possessions there is a practical homogeneity of peo
ple and equality of climatic or physical conditions, so
that labor approximates the same scale and the stan
dard of life the same conditions throughout the
United States.
When we enter the tropics conditions change to a
difference that is irreconcilable. All tropical coun
tries are poor, all tropical labor and life are upon a
plane fixed by the climate. American wages will
never be paid in the tropics, because American labor
cannot go there to earn them. English wages, which
are the nearest ours, are not paid anywhere in the
tropical possessions of the empire, because English
workmen cannot live there. The British Isles do
rot suffer by free trade with the tropics, beciuse they
are not producers in competition with the tropics.
Those isles raise no cotton, nor sugar, nor citrus
fruits, nor tobacco, nor rice, nor hemp. They do not
even raise corn. Free trade with regions that pro
duce these things is an advantage to Great Britain.
But we raise them all at home. We can produce
all the sugar we need, when stability of policy makes
safe the necessary investment. In Eastern Texas, in
the lowlands of Louisiana and in Alabama, Georgia
and South Carolina we can produce a surplus of rice
over our own demand for consumption. In Mis
souri, Kentucky and California we can raise all the
hemp we require. *l~he tobacco lands of North Caro
lina, in the valley of the Housatonicand the Con
necticut, in Ohio, Wisconsin and California
can produce all the grades of tobacco below
the luxurious brand that is a climatic monopoly of
Cuba. We supply two-thirds of the world's con
sumption of raw cotton. California has a fruit pro
ducing capacity that can supply our home market and
a surplus for export with citrus fruits, raisins, and
the whole range of dried and tinned products of the
orchard. All of this vast and varied production is
the result of American labor, paid on the American
scale of wages. Free trade with the tropics means
competition in all of it with a permanently lower scale
of wages. The iron law of wages is their approxi
mation to the cost of living. Where the standard of
life is high, wages rise to it. Where it is low, they
fall to it. In the tropics the necessities of existence
are few, they are supplied with little labor, and the
multiplication of human wants is impossible, since
they are all measured by physical and social neces
sity.
It is well that before plunging into a policy there
be preceding knowledge of the conditions to which it
is applied. This is why The Call has advised that
Congress pau?e for study before launching out upon
legislation for these Spanish islands in the tropics.
The idea of the Chronicle is manifestly erroneous
and is based upon a comparison of conditions that
are incomparable. Things equal have no analogy
with things unequal. lowa and Minnesota, Califor
nia and Florida, have equality of physical conditions
snd approximate equality of wages and life. The
equal operation of public law enforced by the con
stitution can be between them with good effect.
When that equality is extended to the tropics Ameri
can labor will suffer and all American interests will
suffer with it, since the condition of labor fixes all
conditions in this country.
We are anxious only that the people shall not be
deceived â that they shall not even be permitted to
deceive themselves. If we permanently retain these
Spanish islands our labor will need just as much pro
tection against their competitive production as it did
when they were the property of Spain. We cannot
assimilate their people. The flag will not automati
cally raise the wages of labor, nor the standard of life,
ror multiply the wants of man. It is a practical and
rot a sentimental question. The doctrine of protec
tion to American labor is not only vital, but the tests
it will be called upon to bear in the future promise to
be greater than those of the past

orary member of any number of similar
organisations in other lands.
' The object of Mr. Otani's visit to this
country and to Europe, where his travels
took him also, was to study the commer
cial conditions of the world and to gather
data and information which may be of
benefit to the mercantile community of
Japan. He rays that he has been much
Impressed with the advanced theories and
methods in use in the United States, most
of which can be used with equal advan
tage by his countrymen.
Mr. Otani looks forward to an Immense
commerce between this coast and Japan,
and considers the increase in the volume
of business that the past year has seen
merely a promise of the still greater
things. that the future holds in store.
Yesterday Mr. Otani was taken in hand
by Vice President Newhall and Secretary
Scott of the local Chamber, of Commerce
and shown about the city. The Chamber
of Commerce,. Board of Trade and Stock
Exchange were visited and the. distin
guished visitor was given. an opportunity
to thoroughly study the workings of

Sunnyside Needs Fire Protection.
The Fire Commissioners received a pe
tition yesterday from the Sunnyslde Im

nearest engine house was about a mile
and a half away. The petition was placed
on file, it being stated there were no
fur.ds. The question of a uniform, which
has been bothering the board for some
time, was settled yesterday by the adop
tion of that at present in use.

THE HOLMES QUARTET
AND MRS. LLOYD-SMITH
The first of the fortnightly popular con
certs of the Henry Holmes quartet took
place yesterday afternoon at the Califor

soloist and Fred Maurer the accom
panist. The Instrumental numbers con
sisted of Schubert's posthumous quartet
in D minor, Haydn's variations on "God,
Preserve tho Emperor" and the E flat
quintet of Schumann.
The quartet, which is composed or
Henry Holmes, first violin; Hothar Wis
mer, second violin; Armand Solomon,
viola, and Theodore Mansfeldt, violon
cello, played without emotional quality
and did not succeed in giving the music
any interest beyond that which is to be
found In mere accuracy. Mr. Holmes*
tone is quite full.- but his bowing is fre
quently feeble, and he seemed at times J
to infect the whole quartet with insecur
'cedle Hardy sang "Elsa'a Dream," from
"Lohensrrin." and "Since Firsf I Met
Thee," by Rubinstein. She has an in
equable voice, limited in compass, and in
the Wagner Item was not adequate to the
task. The best music was contributed,
strangely enough, by the accompanist.
Fred Mauer, who in spite of an artificial
style plays with unusual taste and ex
pression. * Â« â¢
On 'Tuesday evening Mrs. Adelaldo
Lloyd-Smith gave a concert at Sherman.
Clay & Co.'s Hall, assisted by the MlnetU
quartet and Cantor E. J. Stark. Mendels
sohn's quartet in E flat major and the
Romanze from a Grieg quartet were ad
mirably rendered by Mr. Minetti and his
confreres. The music that is furnished
us by these artists is of a high order of
merit, and they always succeed in rous
ing their audience to a respectable aaow
of enthusiasm.
Cantor Stark sang "Eri Tv" from
Verdi's "Vn Ballo" and Schumann's
"Two Grenadiers." His immense voice
is not lacking in musical quality and his
use of tone color is altogether admirable.
Mrs. Lloyd-Smith made a bad selection
for her first number, a waltz song by
Ardlte, but It really makes little differ
ence what she might sing, for her ability
is slender and her voice anything but
pleasant. She sang off the pitch almost
continually, and at times the dissonance
was excruciating. The anxiety of some
singers to appear in public Is often as
great as their merit is small.

"Reputed friends of the Sugar Trust had wads of $1000 bills that would balk a
hurdle jumper."
Now, all and singular, we denounce these statements and insinuations as lies, de
liberately coined and printed, not only to the intended injury of the good name of Sena
tor Bard, but greatly to the injury of California. There were no such stories current,
except as they were current between and among the "special commissioner" liars in the
employ of the Examiner, compelled to shamelessly debauch their consciences down to
the level of their employer. If there be any one "who claims to know" that money stained
the result or passed to accomplish it, outside the lying drabs who are scarlet with the sins
committed by command of their master, let him be produced. If Mr. Herrin heard that
$100,000 had been passed, he must have heard it from some one. Produce that witness.
If the Examiner know that Mr. Herrin "heard" any such thing, it must have that infor
mation from Herrin himself, for no other could tell what he heard. We challenge it
to produce Mr. Herrin as a witness that he heard such a thing, and told the Examiner.
We challenge the proof that any Examiner "special commissioner" saw wads of
$1000 bills, or saw a single $1000 bill exposed in betting or otherwise in the contest.
We do not propose to permit this slander of California and attack on an honor
able man to pass unchallenged. t From the time the Examiner exchanged the lilies and
languors of virtue for the roses and raptures of vice, and ceased to be respectable as it
was under the editorship of Pen Johnston and Phil Roach, it has ceaselessly de
graded the standard of politics in this State. The only candidate in its own party who
has reached the Senatorship since then without the payment of a dollar in bribery was
Hon. Stephen M. White, and it opposed and fought and defamed, him throughout his
campaign. It has never failed to support Democratic candidates for the Senate who
were able and willing to buy the office, and has opposed those who were either unable
or unwilling.
It ill becomes a political lattice tapper and painted Jezebel, a debauched de
baucher of others like the Examiner, to pin the garments of virtue. on its reputation that
is so diseased that all the medicinal waters of the Hot Springs cannnot sweeten it again,
and by echoing its own lies weave a poison slander around the fair fame of an honestly
elected and high-minded Senator.
We challenge it again to present the proof of its charges, or stand with one
more brand added to the marks of sin that already deface it.

saki but who were recaptured soon after
that vessel sailed for San Francisco, and
the remains of 8 soldiers. The Pathan

while the Indiana has aboard the remains
of 123 dead soldiers.
There was general rejoicing aboard the

transport Logan had not arrived in port.
The two steamers left New York together
and, by avoiding two ports of call, the
Logan made the run to Manila in S6 hours
better time than the Sherman. Captain
Grant of the latter vessel Insists, how
ever, that in actual steaming time his
vessel beat the Logan two hours.
There has been more or less discussion
over this matter for some months back,
so the crews of both transports were
more than pleased when both were sched
uled to sail for San Francisco on tho
same day. The vessels coaled at Naga
saki with Japanese fuel and the Sherman
sailed on January 21 at 8:30 p. m., with
the Logan to follow her at 6 p. m. Owing
to the number of sick men he bad aboard,
Captain Grant took the outside passage
and the southern route, while the Logan
sailed by way of the inland sea and the
great circle route. The distance by tha
southern route is considerably longer than
that by the great circle, but the Sher
man made the run In 17 days and reached
port first.
Chief Engineer George R. Klngsland of
the Sherman was sick during the first
three weeks after the vessel left San
Francisco, but he was aa well as ever
almost when the transport left Manila-
He was determined to make a good run
home and every engineer in the ship was
of the same mind. In consequence the
Sherman's engines made more revolutions
an hour with the poor Nagasaki coal than
they did with tho best kind of English
fuel on the passage down.
The Sherman never before came irto
port In such a spick and span condition,
and Captain Grant says the voyaga bus
been most pleasant throughout. To
Chief Officer A. M. Walton and Chief
Steward J. J. Fallon Is mainly due tha
yachtllke appearance of the big trans
port. Everything alow and aloft was in
the very best of order and officers and
men are on tho best of terms with each
other.
After leaving here olxty-thres days ago
the Sherman went to Honolulu. The Lu
bonic plague was prevalent, and Captain
Grant shaped his course for Guam. Dur
ing the run to Guam measles broke out
among the colored troops, and when tha
island waa reached communication with
the shore was prohibited. Years ago a
case of measles was landed on Guam and
it almost destroyed the native populaUon.
The hospital ship Yosemlte was in port
while the Sherman was at Guam. There
was twenty-eight cases of typhoid fever
among the crew.
As tha collier Brutus had left Guam for
Manila with the disabled transport Vic
toria in tow a couple of days before the
Sherman arrived, the Sherman had to
proceed on her way without getting any
coal. Manila was reached without mis
hap. The Sherman made the round trip
in sixty-three days, being the third -time
in succession she has performed that
feat This Is a splendid record and
stamps the vessel as one of the finest
transports in the fleet.
The Indiana and Pathan left Manila
and Nagasaki six days ahead of the Sher
man, and both made port a few hours
after her. .. _.
The cabin passengers on tha Sherman
were: Major W. S. H. Matthews sur
geon. U. S. A.: Major F. A. Cook, Twen
ty-sixth Infantry; Captain N. D. Bolton.
Sixteenth Infantry; Mrs. N. D Bolton
and Miss Bolton. Lieutenant Hutchinson.

tv-nrst Infantry; Halstead Dorey, Fourth
Infantry-; A? ll Wetherill. Sixth Infan
try; Paymaster Gaw, U. S. A.; J. J.
O'Brien and the Misses Louise F. Honi*
and Eleanor Underwood.
During the voyage Corporal Martin A.
Dillon of the Signal corps and Private
Alfred Holmes of Company D, Four
teenth Infantry, died. Holmes breathed
his last Tuesday night while the trans
port was hove to off the heads awaiting
the lifting of the fog to make port. The
remains of the other men brought up by
the Sherman were: Lieutenant Ward
Cheney Fourth Infantry; Lieutenant
Daniel 'Bowman. Thirty-seventh Infan
try; Lawrence de Witt, corporal. Cora
panv D. Thirty-second Infantry; Ennls
Wilfiams, Company H. Twenty-eight 1 !
Infantry: William N. Brotherton, Com
pany A, Eleventh Cavalry; Benjamin Ha
worth, Company C, Third Infantry.
The sick soldiers on the Sherman were
landed at the. Presidio and the four de
serters were turned over to the military
authorities at Alcatraz. They were pris
oners who escaped from the Meade and
were recaptured. â¢
The transport Conemaugn is to sail to
day with a load of horses for General
Otis. The transport St. Paul left Naga
eaki shortly before the Sherman and
should arrive to-day.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's mail
steamer Australia sailed for Honolulu
yesterday with an unusually heavy
freight, but very few passengers. Those
who went in the cabin were: Miss E. A.
Bailey. Mrs. G. J. Becker. Miss L. Bollea,
John G. Carpenter and wife, C D. Chase
and wife. Mrs. R. A. Dodd. Mrs. J. J.
Egan and child. T. A. Pettus, William
Sexton and Fred Seybolt.
The Harbor Commisisoners met yester
day and adopted the plans for the new
ferry depot. Bids will now be- called for
and In another fortnight the structure
will ba wall under way.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Transports Sherman and Logan Racing to San Francisco.
This was McDonald's round. The pace
slowed a little in the fourth. The begin
ning of the end appeared In the fifth.
Green landed a right swing which caught
McDonald and dazed him. He went down
from a right on the Jaw and barely lasted
the round out by clinching. He came
back in the sixth and last round with .a
little dash, but a left on the head left
him helpless. His defense was game and
he held on the ropes dazed. He was
knocked down and as he was being
counted out his seconds threw up the
sponge. It was some time before he re
covered sufficiently to leave the ring.
Green fought a great battle and showed
himself an Improved boxer since his last
appearance in the ring. ..,,,.,â
Joe Bell gained the decision over "Kid
Johnson in the opening bout after eight
rounds of the most stubborn fighting.
Each man in turn had a lead over his
opponent, but could not end the battle.
Bell was the aggressor through the
greater part of the bout. Early In the
first round he caught Johnson a right on
the head, dazing him and knocking him
down. It looked to be all up with John
son, but after he was down three seconds
the bell rang signaling the end of the
round.
Bell proved a hard hitter In the second
round and took much of the steam out of
Johnson's blows. The boys fought all over
the ring in the third round, standing up
and exchanging blow for blow. In the
fourth round Johnson hit repeatedly In
the clinches and was warned by Referee
McGinley. The fifth round opened slowly,
but toward the end it was desperate
fighting. Bell bled from nose and mouth
from Johnson's frequent Jabbing. A slight
trickle of blood from Johnson's right ear
showed where Bell had landed on him.
It seemed that one or the other of the
men would go out repeatedly during the
last three rounds, but neither had a punch
to do the work.
A head-on collision between runaway
locomotives could hardly make a greater
commotion than the ciash in the first
round of the bout between Charles Thurs
ton and Charles Fredericks. Thurston
tried to bring the trouble to an end at
once, but was unable to do so. Fredericks
was game, although badly cut about the
mouth and nose. The bout was stopped
temporarily In the fourth round because
of a claim of foul made by Fredericks.
Referee McGinley decided there had been
no foul and the men fought the eight
rounds, Thurston getting the decision.
Fully 2000 spectators were at the ring
side, crowding every Inch of floor space.
Nearly as many more were turned away,
the police refusing to allow any more
In the building. The crush was so great
that extra police were sent for to keep
the crowd In check.
May Reduce Peddlers' Licenses.
The Supervisors Committee on Chari

pacitated by physical ailment. The com

Miss Alice Hoffman "Wins San Fran
cisco Golf Club's Council's Cup.
The final round of the first competition
for the Council's cup for ladles took place
yesterday on the links of the San Fran
cisco Golf Club. The competition was un
der similar conditions to those regulating
the contest for the Council's cup for men.
which was recently won by R. H. Gay
lord. A qualifying round over eighteen,
medal play, waa first held, and the eight
lowest scorers In this entered the opening

qualified were Miss Alice Colden Hoff
man. Mrs. H. C. Breeden, Miss Maud
Mullins. Miss Sarah Drum. Miss Caro
Crockett. Miss Mary Scott. Miss Edith
McÃean and Miss Ella "Wllcox Morgan.
The winners In the first round were Miss
Mary Scott, Misa Maud Mullins, Mrs. H.
C. Breeden and Miss Alice C. Hoffman.
In the semi-final round Miss Maud Mul
lins beat Miss Mary Scott, and Miss Alice
C. Hoffman proved victorious over Mrs.
H C. Breeden. In the final round Miss
Maud MulUns was 3 up on the first nine
holes but on the second nine holes Miss
Alice Hoffman was 5 up, or 2 up on the
eighteen holes. Miss Hoffman's name will
accordingly be the first Inscribed on the
Council's cup and she also takes a small
silver replica of the large trophy. ThÂ©

match play. The winner's score was
made higher than the loser's by the fact
of her taking eleven strokes for the six

LONG TERM PRISONERS
TO BE TAKEN EAST
THBEE WTLL LEAVE TO-NIGHT
UNDER A GUARD.
They Will Be Sent to thÂ« United
States Penitentiary at Fort
Leaven-worth, Eans.
The three long term prisoners who
came over from Manila on the transport
Meade will be sent East this evening in
charge of a guard from the Presidio. Tha
guard will consist of two non-commis
sioned officers and four privates, under
command of Second Lieutenant R. P.
Brov.-er of the Third Artillery. The men
forming the guard are Quartermaster
Sergeant William J. Buchanan and Cor
poral Charles Schoenthaler of Troop F,
Sixth Cavalry, and Privates George E.
Montgomery and P. J. Kelly of Battery
O. Third Artillery and L. G. Ashton and
R. Nixon of Troop G, Sixth Cavalry.
The prisoners are to be sent to tha
United States penitentiary at Foxt Leav
enworth. Ivans. They are under sentence
of twenty-five years' confinement, the
charges being robbery and assault. Tha
sentences passed on the three by the
court-martial before which they were
tried was death, but the President com
muted it to twenty-five years' imprison
ment, with the usual accompaniment of
dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of
all pay and allowances.
The prisoners at Alcatraz are too many
for the post. It cannot accommodate all
that are being sent here from Manila as
well as those coming from this depart
ment, and so the worst are to be sent
East In squads, to be distributed among
the various Government penitentiaries.
Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin F. Pope,
deputy surgeon general, L. S. A., has re
ported at headquarters. He Is on his way
to Manila as president of an examining
board, which will pass upon the qualifica
tions of a number of the acting assistant
surgeons now doing duty In the Philip
pines who wish to enter the regular ser
vice. Colonel Pope was chief surgeon on
the staff of General Shatter during tha
Cuban campaign. He came home from
Cuba on sick leave, and having been re
turned to duty he has been ordered to
the Philippines. Besides Colonel Pope, th*
board Is made up of Captain Frederick
P. Reynolds, assistant surgeon; Captain
William J. Wakeman. assistant surgeon,
and Captain Guy L. Edy. assistant sur
geon. Captain Edy is already In thÂ© Isl

Green too
clever for
McDonald
Outgenerals the Local Boxer
in a Terrific Ring
Battle.
Jack McDonald, a boxer just out of the
amateur ranks, gave "Soldier" Phil Green
of Oakland the hardest kind of an argu
ment in their bout in the Columbia Ath
letic Club arena last night. McDonald
was game to the end. taking a lot of
punishment and showing wonderful apt
itude for boxing. He showed his lack of
knowledge of ring tactics and that, with
one fatal mistake he made, lost him the
honors of possibly a brilliant victory.
When the two combatants discussed
the rules to govern their meeting Mc-
Donald insisted In being allowed to hit
In the clinches. This was his mistake,
as ho intended to insist on hitting in the
breakaway, an entirely different method
of attack. He seemed a mere novice in
the hands of Green for several rounds,
aa thÂ© latter hammered him about the
ribs whenever they clinched. This went
on until thÂ© third round, when McDonald
learned the trick, but much damage had
been donÂ© and some of his vitality must
have been sapped by the body punching
he bad received.
The third round was In the nature of a
rough-and-tumble fight with Referee Mo-
Ginley trying to separate the two big
men. McDonald landed one effectiveblow,
a heavy right on the head which took
some of the go out of Green for a time.
The second round was give and take, the
fighting being fast throughout. Green
tired In the third round, taking some
terrific punches on the head and body.

CURTIS' DOGS
DIVIDED AT
UNION PARK
Representatives of San Jose
Kennels Ran One, Two
in Midweek Stake.
Curtis & Son's greyhounds Narcissus
and Flying Fox divided the midweek
stake at Union Coursing Park yesterday.
For a time it seemed that McKinley, from
the same kennels, would finish in third
place, but he was retired In thÂ© next to
the last round by London's Magneto. This
dog ran In improved form during the af
ternoon. In the last round he met Narcis
sus and led him to the hare. The hare
then favored Narcissus long enough for
him to even the score and make it an
undecided course. In the run-off Magneto
seemed to have lost his great burst of
speed and was beaten.
There was the usual number of upsets
In the betting. Merciful beat Daisy Dale
at 1 to 2; Master Mat beat Blacklock 2 to
5: Lady Blanche beat Terrona 1 to 2;

NEW CLUB
CHAMPIONS
DEVELOPED
Exciting Wrestling Contests
on the Olympic Athletic
Club Mat
Slr.ew and science was displayed at the
wrestling tournament held last night at
the Olympic Club. At the end of two
I hours' exciting sport four new wrestling
I champions were crowned with victory.
and will be invested with the club
medal In their various classes. Instructor
Miehling deserves credit for developing
| tome clever exponents of the ancient
j pastime. The science and strength d!s
j played in the bouts was a revelation to
' the three hundred club members who sal
: around the wrestling mat.
Henry B. Russ, an old-time champion,
i acted as referee and gave satisfaction.
: The timekeepers were Kenneth Melrose
j and Leon Greenebaum. A. M. Stone ofll
! elated as announcer. The first bout was
! between two featherweights, James A.
! McKenzie and Will McLaren. McKenzle
j won the first fail In seven minutes and
the eecond in the sÂ£.me length of time,
and was declared the club's featherweight
champion.
G. A. Hensley and C. D. Pentony, llght
| weights, were the next pair to take thÂ©
mat. Hensley won the first and eecond
falls in 11 minutes and 3 minutes, respec
tively, which entitles him to the class
medal.
In the welter-weight class J. H. Pray
was defeated by J. H. Splro. The latter
gained his victory in two straight falls,
one in 2 minutes 30 seconds and thÂ© other
in 11 minutes 30 seconds. Some exciting
work was displayed in this bout, both
men crawling out of tight places by light
ning moves. Pray showed remarkable
ability for the short time he has taken
up the sport. Spiro Is looked upon as the
I strongest member In the club. He ranks
a close second to Professor Miehling for
I strength.
The next event was a middle-weight
j contest. In which William Noethig, Will
j Franklin and F. B. Bayly participated.
j There being three entries In this class. It
j necessitated the wrestling of a bye.
Xoethig and Franklin were the first to
j try conclusions. Neither could obtain a
fail in twenty minutes' hard tussling, but
XoÂ«thig was awarded a decision for ag
gressiveness. Franklin is a novice at the
game, but has it In him to make a good
opponent. Bayly and Franklin next
! wrestled a bye. the victor to wrestle
j Noethig for the championship of the
class. Bayly secured a fall In two min
utes and was then pitted against Noethlg,
whom he defeated in two bouts in 2 mln
1 utes 45 seconds and 1 minute 35 seconds
I respectively.
ThÂ© final event was a special match be
tween William McCullough and Fred Hab
ley. who Is a brother and counterpart of
Will Habley. a former champion wrestler.
The first fall was obtained by McCullouerh
in 2 minutes 15 seconds and the second fall
by thÂ© same man In 1 minute 5 seconds.

7New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. F^b. ".âThe stock market to
day offered a striking demonstration of the
weakness engendered by a sudden and violent
advance in prices and the reckless speculative
ventures thereby invited. The professional bear
operator* found an easy prey in the swarm
of speculators who have been buying stocks
for a week past on rr.argln with borrowed
money. In the latter part of the day the
bears twonperj upon the market, offering prices
with apparent recklessness and playing havoc
with speculative accounts held on narrow mar
gins. The wiping out of these margins left
no alternative to the holders but to throw
over their stocks in order to avoli losses. The
bull leaders cf larger caliber had been either
realizing profits a' the higher level ar.d were
willing to see a reaction In prices to get Into
the market again or withholding 1 support from
the market with a view to shaking off the.
undesirable following of speculators with small
resources, who constituted a menace to the
further advance in prices, it was this class
that were the principal sufferers In to-day's
shaking out. people who control large capital
and who bought In the panics of December and
started the bull movement last week have
taken profits or. a very large scale. Their sell
ing was met by bo large a demand up to
to-day as to keep up the level of prices. There
was evidence during the morning of continued
larg* absorption &.t some points In the list,
notably In sugar, said to be covering for the
bear account, and Pennsylvania. Union Pacific
and Tobacco. Some ttocks cf minor Import
ance alÂ»o continued to advance, but It soon
became manifest that the selling pressure was
greater than the new demand could absorb.
It was then that the bears made a fierce raid
on the vulnerable spots. They clipped 6%

number of the metal â¢tc-kÂ». Conspicuously

Our Immense Foreign Trade.
According to the figures of the Bureau of

United States in the year Just ended has for
the first time crotsÂ»d the two billion dollar
line and the total exports of manufactures of
iron and eteel have lor the first time crossed
the one hundred million dollar line. In the
calendar year ISM the total exports of Iron
and steel amounted to J27.000.000. and In lb?3
they were $10Â£.tS&.G4a. Meantime the importa
tions of manufacture* of iron and steel have
decreased with nearly equal rapidity, the Im
portations of ISSO twir.g $44.Â£44.1Â«0. and those

Wezv York Monex Market
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The easier condition of the money market
if likely to be a strong stimulus to buying of
docks. The foreign markets are all In a much
easier condition than expected; and. while it
Is quite within the range of probabilities that
we export gold before long such a contingency
causes no uneasiness among local bankers.
The African war has ceased to be an Im
portant factor; apparently It has been fully
discounted: even the reverse at Spion Kop had
little effect in London, and absolutely none In
\ eff York. Our Â¦financial Independence of Eu
rope it Is plain to all. was never bo real as
now and we can regard ordinary disturbances
over there with more equanimity than form
â¢ The : anxiety about gold shipments is now
entirely removed cwing to the plethoric con
dition of the money market. If the Bank of
Krsgland should want our gold now ani will
pay high enough for It we can very readily
j>art with $20.01)0,000 or more without any dis
comfort. This is the reason why our stock
market refused to retreat on the news early in
the week of General Bullers disastrous re
treat. This incident was a strong test of the
situation and was evidence that our market
had cut adrift frcm the South African war
influences. No matter what happens now in
South Africa the conditions on this side war
rant an advance in the price of stocks, and
they are now most decidedly headed that way.
The money market warrants it; the earnings
of the railroads warrant it: the general pros
perity cf the country warrants it. and the out
look for the future warrants it. and there is
no legitimate reason that can now be adduced
against it." __^^_â

W. B. Sumner*s circular says of Hiden:
"Wet salted Hides are quiet at lower prices.
Tanners have small supplies ahead and stocks
are accumulating on the hands of the dealers.
We do not look for any further decline, but
anticipate dull trading for the next few weeks.
Pry Hides and Kip, In sympathy with salted
stock, have declined, but continue in good de
mand and sell readily at prices quoted. Dry
Calf Skins are active, with no change in
prices. There Is a fair demand and a steady
market for Horse Hidea. Large quantities of
Deer Skins come to the market from the Nortn
and Northwest and Mexico. The demand is
active, with prospects for a well sustained
market."

New York Grain and Produce.
BOSTON. Feb. 7.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
The feature of the market has been the
continued demand for wools grading quarter
blood and below, and aside from this demand
the market has been quietâ quieter in fact than
during the previous week. Customers are
chiefly after the low priced wools, although
some high priced wools have been taken, nut
mostly for mixing purposes. Prices on me
dium and lower wools have ruled very steaaj.
There Is absolutely no speculation at present,
and purchases are wholly for consumption.
Local rale* of the week in Boston amounted
to 3.117.000 domestic and CS.OOO pounds foreign,
a total of 3.152.000 pounds, against 4.4-4.000
pounds for the previous week, and a total Â°l
4.260.000 pounds for the corresponding week last
year. The sales since January 1 amount to
21.421.600 pounds, against 22.142.000 pounds for
the corresponding' time last year.

CHICAGO. Feb. 7.â May wheat opened %@%o
over yesterday at 67%@67%c, supported by the
Paris advance and prediction of a cold wave.
The market touched 67% c and then the ascent
began which was continued to the end. The
trade was active and the market broad. Liver
pool turned strong and advanced on reports of
weather menacing to the crop In France, and
It was feared, the same cables reported, that
Argentine shipments would be delayed. The
conditions were a support to the local mar
ket. The most cheerful news, however, from
a bull standpoint was that the export demand
which day after day has been labeled "slack"
had improved. In confirmation of this New
York reported fifty-nine loads taken for ex
port, while 200,000 bushels were sold here for
direct export. The price for May was steadily
bid up to 65%568%c, at which it clOÃed l%@lÂ»ic
over yesterday.
The corn market was strong and active the
greater part of the session. The main Influence
was the report that the Argentine crop was
suffering from extreme heat. May closed %@
%c over yesterday at 33%Â®33%c.
The oats market was strong, but trade wu
smaller. May closed Me up at 23% c.
In the face of heavy hog receipts and lower
prices at the yards provisions showed strength
which excited the admiration of trader*. May
pork closed 2%Â©6 c over yesterday. May lard
a shade down and May ribs 2%@5c over yes

Columbia .. Portland (Feb. 17. 10am|Pler24Convention at Redlands.
A number of special cars, containing
forty delegates and several hundred mem
bers of the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation, left yesterday for Redlands,
where the Y. M. C. A. wilj hold Its nine
teenth annual State convention. The San
Francisco division will be represented at
the convention by Rolla V. Watt, Cap
tain B. D. Ewing, Edw-ard Coleman, AÂ»-
Row in a Josshouse.
A fracas, which was quickly. quelled by
Sergeant McManus and posse, occurred
last night in the Ng Yung Josshouse on
Waverly place. The Ng Yungs were en
gaged in the election of a secretary who
serves for the Six Chinese Companies,
and there was much rivalry among the
several tongs as to who should be ' the
person chosen. The Wong family finally
carried off the honors, and Immediately a
free-for-all fight took place. The officers
were soon on the spot, but no arrests
were made.
NINE WEIGHERS APPOINTED.
Radical Change Made in One of the
Custom-House Departments.
A radical change was made yesterday
In the Weighers' department of the cus
tom-house by order of the Secretary of
the Treasury- Hitherto there have been
on the lists from fourteen to seventeen
extra assistant Weighers, who reported
for duty every morning and took their
chances of getting something to do. This
procedure was very unsatisfactory, be
cause the employes received no pay for
the time spent by them In waiting for an
assignment to duty, and they naturally
thought that Uncle Sam was rich enough
to pay for those who also serve by stand
ing and waiting. They made a proposi
tion that they 6hould be allowed pay for
the fraction of a day consumed in re
porting for duty, but this proposition
was not entertained favorably by the de
partment. Port Collector Jackson cut the
knot by proposing that nine of the num.
ber. selected in accordance with length
of service, should be appointed assistant
Weighers, to be on duty every day, and
that the others should take turns when
ever extra help might be required.
The Secretary of the Treasury approved
of the suggestion as being feasible, and
Just to the men, and the Collector re
ceived a letter yesterday authorizing him
to make the change. The Collector there
upon appointed the following as assistant
Weighers, the salary to be $1100 per an
num: J- W. Silk, D. McCool, Denis Fine
gan. John MT. Durkin. James P. Foley, D.
J Moynihan, S. I. Marston, D. A. Law
le'r and G. L. Hahn.

| A Baby's |
f Taste |
Â£ guided to
| Grape=Nuts. |
Rev. S. V. Robinson, Brooklyn Hills,
N. V., says: "A few days ago an inci-
dent occurred in my home that may in-
terest you. Our baby boy, a fine speci-
men of two years and three months old
babyhood, was brought downstairs im-
mediately after he awoke. He was teeth-
ir.g, and had eaten but little for two or
three days, and had to be coaxed to do
that. On this particular morning his first
request was for Grape-Nuts, of which
he is very fond. His mother had some
corarneal mush cooked, and served
him with that instead, but after he haG
looked at it for a moment he pushed
it away indignantly, saying: 'I don't
want that; I want Grape- Nuts.' He
would not be satisfied until Grape-Nuts
were served to him, which he ate with
evident enjoyment. We were interested
in his discrimination, and you will
doubtless appreciate the boy's taste."
Probably no food in existence â not
even excepting the very best prepared
baby foods â is as well. adapted to the
use of infants as Grape-Nuts, well
soaked. The food is made up in jjran-
ular form, and for children should be
soaked a few minutes in hot water,
when it becomes a mush, and should be
treated with cream and sujrar.
It contains the elements required for
building the bone?, and the pray matter
in the nerve centers. A child or an
adult fed on Grape-Nuts will show
marked improvement in physical and
mental ability. Many of the elders tes-
tify to the removal of physical ailments
by abandoning portions of the food that
have been in use and taking up Grape-
Nuts rejrularly.

FIRST UNITARIANS MEET.
Woman Elected for the First Time to
the Board of Trustees.
General cheerfulness marked the well
: attended annual meeting of the First
Unitarian Church on Tuesday evening.
The reports of Frank J. Symmes,' the
moderator, and James D. Bailey, the
treasurer, and of the ladles at the head
'of the auxiliary, organization were all
distinctly encouraging. The church
treasury carries forward a few hundred
' dollars balance and there are no debts.
Dr. Stebbins has largely recovered his
health, but his strength will not be taxed
by the care of the church. Rev. Dr.
Bradford L*Â»avitt, the new minister,
gives excellent satisfaction, and the
future of the church is full of promise.
An election was held for three trustees,
and for the first time a woman waa
elected to the board. Mrs. Horace Davis,
Frank J. Symmes and Sheldon G. Kel
logg were named for a period of three
years. After the reading of the reports
from the Channlng Auxiliary, the Society
for Christian Work, the Sunday-school
and two funds for the relief of the" poor,
Mr Leavitt and Dr. Stebbins made Drief
addresses, and the â¢ meeting adjourned
for social intercourse and tempting re
freshments. . ;
SHIRLEY SUIT ENDED.
Defendant Falls to Appear and Case
Is Thrown Out of Court.
BOSTON, Feb. 7.â The bottom dropped
out to-day of the four suits of entry
brought by Mrs. Katherine Shirley of
Kansas City against John Stetson Sr.,
Mrs. Emma Stokes, "W. S. Bangs and
another to recover various parcels of real
estate in this city of the value of about
11.000.000 left by the late John Stetson, as
the alleged daughter and only heir-at-law
of Mrs. Kate Stokes Stetson. The col
lapse occurred In the second division of
the Superior Court before Judge Blod
gett, when the defendant failed to appear
in person or by counsel to try her actions
when they were called. Sic was ac
cordingly ordered by the court to be non
suited, and this throws her actions out of
court.
Much has been published concerning her
claims of being a daughter of the late
Mrs. John Stetson, to whom was devised
all her husband's property, and who died
shortly afterward without a will.
PRIVATE HARRY HUBER.
Feb. 7.â Harry Huber, son of C. O. Huber of this city, who
)] was a member of the hospital corps of the Fourteenth United States reg-
J/ ulars. spent a year as a prisoner in the hands of the Filipinos. During
â that time he was dragg"?d from prison to prison and was finally rescued
th Ueuter.ar.t Giilraore of the Yorktown. His first letter since his release
v received to-day by his father. It gives his experiences for those twelve
?ary months and reads in part:
MANILA. P. L. Jan. 7. '00.
I Â»m safe Â»n<J well, and with the Americans once more, after twelve months
a prisoner with the iceuixents. I can not express niy feelings at being free
cac* tsore. As I lock back it all 6eeir.s like a <lrÂ»am and as I think of some
of the perilous positions I have been In. It almost scares me. Marched and
starved tor days at a time, barefoot and almost naked, through 6wamps, rivers
ar.i ever mountains?, to be finally retaken by the brave boys in blue. In the
heart of the mountains of Oeirayan. when we had be*n abandoned and left to
d;e.
Too know that ScTinichsen and myself went out on January 17. IS3S. to takÂ«
nome snap shots. I had the permission of the steward of my ward to leave the
ho?pital. as I was on nlirht duty. We took the 9 o'clock train for Malolos.
but at the third station we were arrested and taken cS and had an Interview
with the comandante of that town. J*e was very hoetile and threatened to
kill us. but he thought better of It, made out some papers declaring us Ameri
can â¢pies and sent us on to MaJoloe. where we expected to have an interview
with A^Ti'naldo and that he would get us free.
When we arrived there we were thrown into a dark and dirty cell with
Filipino robbers and murderers, and Riven 5 cents Mexican money and a pint of
rice a day to HvÂ« on. They took cur hats and shoes and most of our clothes.
Prisoners were brouÂ«Ut in moet every day. One day they brought In nix en
rtneers of the United States army, but they were released. I told one of them
to report as If he *ot in before we did. I did not get much chance to talk to
him. Ttoejr trot In safely and reported us. as I was afterward told.
The war broke out Saturday night. February i. very shortly after we were
captured. On Sunday afternoon a wounded general waa brought In on a bloody
litter, which caused irreat excitement among the populace of the town, who
crowded around the jail cryin*. 'â¢Kill thÂ« Americans'." We were moved from
our c*ll to another where there were two other American soldier*. William
Eruce and E. Honnyman. Nevada cavalrymen, and I. Brown, a civilian, who
afterward pr-ored a " traitor, two different times. At San Isabel three of the
beys rot away, bet before Albert and I could escape Brown called the guards
and each of us had a sun placed at our chest?. The other boys were recap
tured tne next day In a town a few miles away.
On March Tl the Americans were advancing so rapidly that we were marched
out of Maloio* on the run. and when cne of us slowed down we were punched
along with the end of a run. We had three days of this without anything
to eat before wÂ« arrived at San lalciro. the new capital.
On thÂ« lÂ«th of April a new prisoner came In. A. Bishop of the Third Artil
lery. HÂ« was captured on outpost. Just outside of Malolos. We stayed up all
night getting the news, and I was relieved when he told me that our names,
which I had written on the walls of the prison at Malolos, had been found-
On th# 22d of April Lieutenant Gtllmore and his outfit came in.
I put our names on the prison wall at San leldro and they were also found.
On May S we had to move again, as the Americans were getting so close.
We were on the road over a month before arriving at Vljan. where wÂ« were
Immediately put into dote confinement under orders from General Tlno.
On November JÂ» fourteen more prisoners came into Bengued from the lower
prm-inrea. and wÂ» got word that the Americans had landed in \lgan. On that
ia.y wÂ« BtartM for the mountains, twenty-six in the party. One night the Fili
pino lieutenant who waa in charge of us told us he was going to abandon us
because his soldiers w*re tirÂ»d cf g-Jardlng us and we were so slow that they
were afraid they would starve in the mountain*. He said he had orders to
kill us. but that he could not do such a cold-blooded act. He added that if
we would et*y there two or three days the Americans would overtake us. We
laughed at such an idea, never thickir.g that the American army would follow
us over Â«uch a trail. But they did. ani they soon overtook us.
Two morning* later, lust as we were about to embark on bamboo rafts to
go down the rirer, it was the happiest moment of my life when I heard a
rvutiTLg cheer ar.d looked up to see the boys In blue shirts and brown pants
come charring down the hill to the river.
It was a s^uad of picked m?n cut of the. Thirtr-thlnJ and Thirty- fourth regi
ments that rescued us and they had been on the trail for two months. Colonel
Hare and Lieutenant Colonel House swore that they would follow us Into hell If
necessary but they would get us. and they did.
We arrived In Abulog on New Tear's day. ar.d the next day marched to
Aparrt. a large town on the coast, where there was a transport waiting for us.
WÂ« sailed that evenlwr and landed In Vigan thÂ» next day. We t'Xik a day's
reel and then came to Manila. Soms of my companions out of the corps are still
her* and a rreat many came to see me.

UNIQUE EFFORT AT
DRAWING UP A WILL
OAKLAND, Feb. 7.â lt will require a
keen i?gal mind to decipher, according to
Mary J. Stone's â¢ olographic will, how
many children she left to enjoy her es
tate, valued at several thousand dollars.
Mrs. Stone was also known as Mary

homestead be kept as long as all agree,
but 'when any one Is dissatisfied the ad
ministrators are to sell."
Two feeble-minded children, 'John
Holmes and Mrs. Charity Hall, are left
to the care of the others, who are request
ed "to do something for them as long as
they live." "And my son, Samuel
Holmes, and daughter, Nellie Shannon,"
continues the Instrument, "don't need
anything: but as I wish to remember
Nellie Shannon, she Is to have my. gold
bowed spectacles, also the silver ones,
and any Jewelry or clothing she wants,
and Samuel is to have a cow. If the
homestead is sold my daughter Pheby
Drake is to have $200, if she is living, and
the balance is to be divided among my
other four children. Louisa Bryan, David
Holmes. Rachel and Lottie Stone."
A codicil, dated January 8, 1900. provides

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â
Senator Perkins to-day called upon At
torney General Griggs relative to a selec
tion of a successor to Judge Johnson in
Alaska. The Attorney General said that
he had received many protests against
the appointment of. a Pacific Coast man
to fill the vacancy, but Senator Perkins
and other Senators and Representatives
of that section have not abandond the
fight and will Insist upon the appointment
or a man from the coast. If President
McKinley should decide to name some one
from California he has to choose from
some of the best legal material there, and
the Senators and Representatives from
Oregon and Washington have also recom
mended the best of lawyers in their
States.
Senator Perkins to-day received a tele
gram from Chief Justice Beatty of the
California Supreme Court protesting
against the proposed reciprocity treaties,
and answered that he was certain Â¦ the
opponents of these treaties would have
enough votes to refer the entire batch to
the Committee on Finance and there let
them stay. It has been one of the policies
of the opposition to the treaties of France.
Jamaica and Argentina to have their con
sideration in this committee.
Senator Perkins and those opposing
these treaties are confident of their de
feat. The Argentine treaty, which re
quires ratification before the 10th instant,
it is confidently said, will never be
brought before the Senate.
The bill Introduced by Representative
Needham, providing for the holding of a
Federal court at i resno, has been re

ACTOR ERNEST HOWELL.
AKLAXD, Feb. 7.â Ernest Howell. a member of the Macdonough Stock
ffy> Company, says that religion and the drama are not Irreconcilable. He
U //declares that Christianity and histrionic art can walk hand In hand.
Both, in his estimation, can be the means of accomplishing great
good.
And Mr. Howell ought to know. He stepped from the church to the
stage. The change was direct. Two years ago Howell was the successful
superintendent of St. Paul's Sunday-school In this city. One Sabbath after
noon he bade his religious pupils farewell. A week later he appeared on the
stage of the Alcazar In San Francisco as a full-fledged actor, and has been
using grease-paint ever since.
"I still believe in religion, and will always do so," he said, "but I see
nothing incompatible between Christianity and acting. A man can be moral
ly good or bad, no matter what profession he enters, and clean plays cer
tainly do a great deal of good. Had I the time I would still be engaged
in Sunday-school work.
"The reason I went on the stage was because I like acting and thought I
possessed a talent for It. ThÂ« other day I met the Rev. Dr. Ritchie, pastor
of the church where I formerly taught Sunday-school, and he congratu
lated me on my success. So you see, all ministers are not against acting."
AGED EPILEPTIC
WOMAN A VICTIM
OF THE FLAMES
Falls Into an Open
Fireplace.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, Feb. 7.
Mrs. Harriet Mathews, aged 70 years,
fell into an open fireplace during an epi
leptic fit at her home In Lorin sever-U
days ago, and on account of burns re
ceived she was to-day subjected '.o a
most painful surgical operation at t). >
Receiving Hospital.
Mrs. Mathews' husband had gone out to
attend to his chickens at the time of the
accident. When he returned to the nous?,
ten minutes later, he found his aged
spouse lying with her head resting
against the hot bricks in the fireplace an 1
her hair burning. Through prompt action
he- saved her from being burned to death,
but her face waa horribly burned, as wero
also her hands. Mr. Mathews imme
diately applied aoothing applications to
his wife's burns and she appeared to be
recovering. But the fingers of her right
hand failed to show signs of healing, an-t
Mr. Mathews brought his wife to the hos
pital to-day. Drs. Milton, Ewer ar.-l
Rowe found it necessary to amputate tha
third and fourth fingers at the thirrl join?.
An amputation was also required between
the first and second phalanx of the fifth
finger.
The operation was exceedingly patn
ful, as, owing to Mrs. Mathews' age. the
surgeons deemed it dangerous to admin
ister chloroform, fearing possible fatal
results.
CLOTHED IN
TWENTY-DOLLAR
GOLD PIECES
Novel Attire of an
Italian Bootblack.
Angelo Saropa, an Italian bootblack, is
not a believer in savings banks, nor has
he any confidence in strong boxes at
home. He was arrested last night for
drunkenness by Officers Holmes and
Burkevitch and when searched at the
California street station nearly $1000 was
found on hi 3 person. The officer who
made the discovery nearly fainted but
was brought to a realization of what was
before him by hearing the gold pieces
tinkle.
Saropa concealed his wealth in an In
ner vest, and when it was taken from
him it showed that he had used Macchia
vellian ingenuity In spreading the money
so that it would not attract attention.
With needle and thread he had carefully
pewed the glittering twenties inside the
lining of the waistcoat, and with another
vest to hide his banking institution he
went about his business and no one would
have been the wiser but for the fact that
he drank too much grape juice.
The money was turned over to the sta
tion-keeper, and the inebriated Italian
will receive it when he is in a fit condition
to care for his fortune.
"The Ideal and the Real."
Mrs. R. S. Llllie lectured last night un
der the auspices of the Liberty Branch of
the Social Democratic Party on "The Ideal
and the Real." at 117 Turk street. A good
sized audience listened to the lecture,
which was followed by a general discus
sion. *
CALIFORNIA TO
EMPLOY COACHES
FROM THE EAST
Athletic Committee's
Demand.
BERKELEY, Feb. 7.â At a meeting of
the student athletic committee of the
University of California held this after
noon some important business was tran
sacted. As far as Berkeley is concerned
Eastern coaches will be employed until
some future student body sees fit to do
otherwise. California, the committee says,
was agreeable to the proposal of Stanford
that Eastern coaches be dispensed with
and some home man employed until the
amendment that the coach must be a
college graduate was added. Berkeley has
a number of available men as coaches
who have attended college but dropped
out before graduation, and to confine the
list of eligible coaches to graduates would
be a hardship. That closes the matter,
and both colleges will now be free to do
as they think best.
The matter of holding the field day on
the Stanford campus will be left to the
faculty athletic committees of both col
leges for llnal decision. They will meet at
the University Club next Saturday after
noon to discuss the matter. The re
vised list of entries, permitting a man to
compete in several events, was adopted.
The committee from the University of
California believe that by having the an
nual field day held at San Francisco or on
their own campus a larger attendance can
be secured. They say they will not ac
cept the proposition to hold the field day
at Palo Alto unless a guarantee is as
sured them to cover preliminary and
training expenses.
extended by the Stanton Club for a dis
cussion at the home of Mrs. Clara Foltz,

the woman question. "Shall Married
Women Hold Salaried Positions, While
Single Women Need Employment." Dr.
J. A. B. Wilson and Mrs. Edholm and

SENSATIONAL
RACE TO-DAY
AT OAKLAND
Yellowtail, F. W. Brode
and Advance Guard Meet. â¢
Three Choices Win.
All Impediments have been removed,
and the flower of the Western three-year
old division will battle for supremacy
over Oakland track this afternoon. The
affair will be a sweepstakes of $250 each,
with 51000 added by the California Jockey
Club, and the distance one mile. 'F. W.
Brode will represent J. F. Schorr & Son,
carrying 114 pounds and Tommy Burns;
Foster & Hackett will bank theirs on the
$10,000 wonder Yellowtall, with Spencer,
the "iceman," and 117 pounds up, while
the Canadian firm of Carruthers &
Shields start Advance Guard, 117 pounds,
piloted by John Bullman.
The race has been the leading toplo
among turfmen for some days, and on
Tuesday almost fell through owing to a
misunderstanding as to which owner
was entitled to the services of Spencer.
Both Alex Shields and Fred Foster
wanted the "Iceman." but when Burns
was reinstated Owner Shields conceded a
point, engaging Bullman. In all proba
bility Yellowtall will go to the post
favorite, as he has been working great
guns, and has already beaten F. W.
Brode. Still the latter is a vastly im
proved colt and will take more beating
now. Advance Guard made such a splen
did showing in the Turf Congress stake,
when downed but a head for show honors
by Zoroaster, that he will not lack friends.
It promises to be the swagger betting
event of the racing season.
The sport yesterday resulted In some
mixed returns, three choices, two out
siders and a second choice capturing
purses. The track is again in very fast
condition. _ " ...
T. Walsh landed the first purse with
Katie Gibbons, a 7 to 1 chance. The dis
tance was six furlongs, and Rio Chlco
had a pronounced call in the betting.
Dan Honig's mare made all the running,
and with something to spare, led the
favorite out a length In 1:14*4. Jack Mc-
Cabe. a 30 to 1 shot, ran a good third.
Looking lean and gaunt. Southern Girl,
with Bullman in the saddle, was sent to
the post a 1 to 2 choice for the sprint over
the Futurity course. Ridden hard from
the jump, she held I- B. McWhirter safe
at the finish, winning by a length. Bam
boulla lost the show to Saul of Tarsus.
After being backed for a good thing on
two occasions Florabird finally won a race
for the Shulte people. Second choice to
Essence in the third event, the Florist
colt downed the 30 to 1 shot Silver Bullion
a head, driving hard. Bullman on Es
sence found himself pocketed at the start,
and after a perilous trip, during which he
was sadly buffeted about, finished third.
The mile and a sixteenth selling affair
fell to David Tenny, the favorite. Bull
man rushed the sturdy little horse to the
front fwhen half the distance had been
covered, and at the stand Tenny was rid
den out to beat imp. Clonsilla half a
length. Jack Martin, on the latter mare,
rode a vexy poor race, or she might have
reversed the decision. Jones finished third
with ,Don Luis. .
Equal choice in the betting on the fifth
number with Harry Thoburn, Foster &
Hackett's mare Peace won all the way.
Spencer on Harry Thoburn rode a very
slouchy sort of a race, circumnavigating
the bunch in time to finish third, five
lengths behind Pomplno.
With 8 and 10 to 1 against his chances
Toribio was never headed in the final mile
selling run. Silver Tone took the place,
while Scotch Plaid, the favorite, ran
fourth.
Track Notes.
T. "Walsh carried off the riding honors
by piloting three winners. Bullman was
a close second with two wins to his
credit.
A. B. Spreckels, owner of Aptos stock
farm has named the suckling colt by
Searchlight (2:03%) from Hulda (2:oS**),
Lyddite. If he proves as powerful a fac
tor In racing as the explosive after which
he is named is in warfare the youngster
should some day be heard of down the
grand circuit.
Conley was suspended pending an in
vestigation into the showing made by Red
Pirate. From all accounts the chestnut
has the reputation of being a "dope"
horse and a notorious in and outer. In
his races run in California he has been
far from a consistent performer, and be
fore the colored boy's livelihood is taken
away these things should bo considered.
If Spencer puts up as good a ride to-day
on Yellowtall as he did yesterday astride
Harry Thoburn the big fellow ought to
be a 30 to 1 shot

L. Turner 60 100DONOVAN IN CHINATOWN.
Sergeant With an excellent Record
Will Suppress Mongolian Crime!.
Sergeant J. T. Donovan, one of the most
efficient officers on the police force, has
been transferred from the O'Farrell street
station to the California street station.
Donovan will now have charge of the
second police district, which Includes Chi
natown and Barbary Coast. His past rec
ord as an officer in the Chines* quarter
induced the change, and his experience is
expected to have much weight in sup
pressing crime among the Mongolians.
Sergeant James Anderson, who has had
charge of the second district for year 3,
will assume Donovan's duties at the
O'Farrell street station.
THE Corinthian Yacht Club will give a vaudeville en
tertainment next Thursday night at Â¦ Xatlve Sons'
Hall, Mason street. The well-known reputation of the
! members as caterers of amusement and dispensers of
fun will undoubtedly draw an Immense audience. Tho
> services of many of the old-time favorites who have made
the Corinthians' entertainments of more than local fame
! have been engaged and. judging from the rehearsal held
, last night, the coming show will surpass all previous ones
' and will be brimful of Interesting features presented by
. clever artists.
Stage Manager "Jack" O'Brien directed operations
; last night and announced that the programme would be
opened with a short address by the recently elected com
! modore. Harry D. Hawks. The commodore was excused
, from rehearsing his turn, as he is preparing something in
' the nature of 'a surprise in opening addresses and does
, not want the edge of his remarks to wear off before tho
' eventful evening. Oscar S. Frank, the sweet singer, tried
over two of his songs, which are destined to make a hit â
"Still as the Nlgrht" and "Don't You Cry, Honey," the lat
; ter with chorus accompaniment.
The "ragtime specialty" is the next number, and as
performed by "Jack" Cathcart and George Ryan Is ex
tremely humorous. They sing "Chickens on the Brain"
and "An Irish Cakewalk" In Inimitable style. Frank H.
Thompson In the bass solo, "The King's Champion," and
others equally as good will repeat his former successes In
the vocal art, while "Dave" McLaughlin, who follows In
his "Dutch 'Witticisms," will most likely tickle the risi
bilities of his audience to the bursting point.
"Pete" Sloan as the "Infant Phenom" sang "Hello,
Daddy. I Knowd Dat Waa Yoh Car," and his infantile
Imitations are exceptionally clever. "Ben" Tarbox, attired
In the costume of a sixteenth century warrior, will be
heard In "The Sword of Ferrara," and no doubt an encore
will be in order.
The skit entitled "Looney's Parisian Ballet" has been
especially written to display the physical charms and terp
sichorean talents of McLaughlin, Ryan and Cathcart in
Imitations of Fougere and as "premiere danseuses." An
amazon march, led by "Big" Thompson and "Little" Ken
nedy, goes with the skit. "Eddy" Angelo only consented
to be an amazon after much persuasion, and he will also
be heard to advantage with his "robusto tenor" In the
choruses. "Billy" Hynes Is down for a black-face tui^,
and when he sings his laughing song others are sure to
follow suit. Slgnor Abramoff is too well known to tell how
he will sing his operatic selections.
A grand double quartet will be heard in "Kentucky
Babe" and "Beauty's Eyes," and consists of: First tenore,
Frank Coffin and Herbert S. Williams; second tenors,
Edwin F. Sagax and Arthur J. Kennedy; first bassos, Ben
L. Tarbox and Harry Turnbull; second bassoa, Frank W.
Thompson and Edward McÃalne.
The performance will conclude with a scene typical of
the clubhouse at Tiburon. Musical selections will be ren
dered by Kelly and Haxe; "Billy" Flnnie will sing a new
song; the Red Rock Quartetâ Thompson, Sloan. Kennedy
and Mitchellâ in "hambone" selections; fancy dancing by
Dave Flnnie; oboe selections, "Gus" Strauss; the whole
concluding with the singing of "Good Night", by a chorus
of fifty voices.
The proceeds of the entertainment will be used to en
large the clubhouse and build a permanent stage for future
productions. Tickets will be- on sale at Sherman & Clay's
next Saturday mo/ning.
FORMAL CHARGE
NOT YET MADE
AGAINST POULIN
<
Case Continued Until
Saturday.
?
PROBABLY CANNOT BE HELD
?
HE IS STUX AT LARGE ON
BIG CASH BAIL.
Â»
Horace Poulin, because of â¢whose deser
tion Amy Murphy killed herself, was be
fore Police Judge Mogan yesterday. He
was allowed to depart again on the $1000
cash ball deposited by his friend McLach
lan. with the understanding that he ap
pear again Saturday forenoon next, at 10
o'clock. The Coroner's inquest will be
held in the meantime and the develop
ments there may give the officers a bet
ter idea of what can be done toward
prosecuting Poulin on some charge.
Twice the bailiff called the name of the
man who has attained bo much unenvia
ble notoriety since the tragedy in the
park, and each time there was no re
sponse. The crowd that had gathered In
the courtroom at once formed the impres
sion that Poulln had jumped his ball,
but this was an error. Judge Mogan an
nounced that he would call the case again
at 12 o'clock and If the man wanted did
not appear at that time he would Issue a
bench warrant and declare the bail for
feited.
Detective Cody sought the telephone
and succeeded in locating Poulln. That
individual and Judge Pierce, his attor
ney, appeared at 11:30. The lawyer said
his client had understood that he was
to appear any time during the forenoon,
and he had been busy all the morning
trying to secure bondsmen in the sum of
$2000, in order that McLachlan might draw
down his $1000 in cash. The excuse was
accepted.
"Has a complaint been filed In this
case?" asked Attorney Pierce.
"There has not." answered the clerk,
and Detective Cody, who was present un
der Instructions from Acting Chief Biggy,
said Mrs. Dart, the mother of the dead
girl, had said she would swear to a com
plaint if the officers could find a charge
on which Poulin could be prosecuted.
Judge Mogan informed Poulln of his
rights and said he could not be arraigned
until a charge had been formally made
against him. Tho court instructed him
that he was entitled to time in which to
prepare a defense and then fixed the time
for his appearance.
During the remarks made at the funeral
of Amy Murphy the Co-operative Home
for loung Women at C 45 Folsom street,
pf which Miss Flora Bellinger is super
intendent, was referred to as a "rescue"
home. This has very much aggrieved the
estimable young ladles who live there.
This institution is maintained solely for
the benefit of respectable working girls,
who by clubbing together get their living
for just what it costs.
A letter was received at police head
quarters yesterday from Los Angeles
signed by Geary H. Day. the writer stat
ing that Amy Murphy was not the first
girl Poulln had led to her death. Because
of him. the writer continued, a girl named
Mary Stout drowned herself in the bay
some time ago. The letter was evidently
written by an Ignorant person, and the
police placed it on the list of crank ef
fusions.
The police telegraphed to Los Angeles
regarding the letter from there. Poulin
denied knowing any girl by the name of
Stout.
Three boys tried to sell a pistol yester
day to J. Whltehead, employed at the car
house at Tenth and Howard streets. The
police. Investigated the case and found
the pistol did not resemble the one Miss
Murphy bought.
much puzzled and later in the forenoon
met their friends on the street. The lat
ter explained that they had given ball
money to the policemen who had started
toward the Jail with them. The amount
paid was $15, or $5 apiece.
The arrested men, according to their
story, not only were made to give up In
order to secure their release, but, being
"broke," were led all over Chinatown In
an effort to borrow the money from
friends. One of them succeeded In get
ting 18 50 at one place, another raised
J3 60 at another house.
One of the men from whom part of the
money was borrowed was brought here
yesterday from San Jose, where he had
fone Monday. The other one Is located,
t Is said the three Chinamen who were
"shaken down" and the two from whem
the money was borrowed will testify to
all the foregoing statements concerning
the alleged extortion.
Balds were made also on Jackson street
and Rosa alley, and those Chinamen who
had It. so the Mongolians declare, were
released upon giving up $3 apiece to the
arresting officers. Those who could not
locate the necessary amount' In their
pajamas became the victims of their pov
erty and were turned into the prison.
All three of these officers were members
of Sergeant Ellis" squad. The other mem
ber of the sauad was Robert L. Morton
of 2913 Bush street. He was not suspenJ
ed, though he has been a running mate of
Rice's since they were placed in China
town. Rice and Morton are of the Cen
tral station and Rlordan and Robinson of
the Seventeenth and Howard street sta
tion, v'
Yesterday forenoon at 9 o'clock, so It
was said In Chinatown last night, all the
officers of Chinatown squads were lined
up at the hall and two of the Chinamen
who claimed they were robbed of $5 each
were asked to point out the men who had
robbed them. They pointed out Rlordan
and Robinson at once.
OnÂ© of tho most Important witnesses
will bÂ© a Chinese native son of 20 Ross
alley. He is said to be the man who first
Informed on the policemen.
Each of the accused men has been on
the force several years. It is not known
how long the system of extortion so sud
denly brought to light by Chief Blggy
has been going on. The first Intimation
of it leaked out Tuesday.

BERNICE McCLELLAN, Who Fell Down an Elevator Shaft.
BERNICB McCLELLAN. a nineteen-year-old girl, residing at 22 Page Â§
street, fell to her death last evening down an elevator shaft In the 8
building, of the Standard Biscuit Company, at the corner of Front and $
Pacific streets. The girl was employed In the place where she met her 8
horrible fate, and was Just preparing Â«> go home after her day's work when Â«
the accident happened. . â¢ ?*
An employe of the company said that after the elevator had ceased run- Â«
ning for the night all the hatchways, which are unguarded, had been closed S
over by means of trap doors, which open upward. He said that the girl had H
stepped on one of these on the third floor and that it gave way with her. X
The force of her descending body tore away the other doors on the second w
and nrst floors, which he claims were also closed. The downward passage Q
of the body was, not stopped until It struck the ground floor â¢?
Another story Is told by girls who are employed in the 'place, that thÂ« ft
doors had been left open and the lights of the building turned out. The Â«
unfortunate girl unconsciously walked to the brink of the shaft and. tot- H
terlng, fell to the ground floor. X
Dr. Thomas B. Leland. autopsy physician, was called after the accident, S
and said that the girl's skull was fractured. Her body was not taken to P
the Morgue. S5
Miss McClellan has been almost the sole support of her parent* and six X
brothers and sisters for some time past. She was pretty, bright and well g
liked by her associates. The body was taken to an undertaking parlor on Â»
Mission street, but will be removed this morning to the home of her uncle. 8

and the Stars of the Ac

Corruption will not stand much chance
in the Police Department of this city as
long as the present alert acting Chief is
In charge of that municipal body. This
was demonstrated clearly yesterday
when acting Chief Biggy created a sen
sation In the department by suspending
three well-known patrolmen on the
charge of extorting money from Chinese
whom they placed under arrest. x
The promptness with which the acting
Chief "got on the Inside" of what was
going on In this particular case was a
matter of surprise and consternation to
those who are charged with the offense
and who will have to answer before the
commission at an early date.
William E. Rice of ISOO McAllister street,
Nell Rlordan of 710 Castro street and Eu
gene C. Robinson, residing at the Russ
House, are the men who were suspected
yesterday and the evidence against them
as it stands now Is very strong. China
men who allege they were victims of the
extortion make direct and positive asser
tions regarding their, yielding up coin to
the bluecoats under suspicion.
It is stated by the witnesses that these
officers have been In the habit when ar
resting men found sleeping In the Chi
nese houses of 111 fame to discharge those
who would pay what the policemen
thought a reasonable price for dismissal
and to jail those who would not give up.
Two of the policemen, Rlordan and
Robinson, according to stories told by
Chinamen last nigh V raided a house In
St. Louis alley early Sunday morning and
arrested three Chinamen there. The of
ficers started with these Chinamen to the
California-street station.
The next morning friends of the ar
rested Chinese went to the station to ball
them out. The desk man there looked
over the books and said there must be a
mistake, as no such names as those
given were on It. The men with the ball
money went downstairs and looked
through the bars. Their friends were not
there. They went back to their quarters

Arrested on tlie Train by.a Sheriff
After Her Secret Flight: From
Butte, Mont., but Is
Soon Released.
MRS. BENJAMIN COWAN of
this city, wbo was formerly Miss
Lena Tolles of San Bernardino,
went ail the way to Butte. Mont.,
last week, kidnaped her little daughter
who had been taken there by the child's
father, fled from the city In the night
time with the little one and reached this
city In eafety last Saturday evening. In
Butte Miss Cowan evaded the officers
who were on the lookout to prevent her
departure from that city and on the way
she bluffed one of the Sheriffs who had
been telegraphed to to arrest her. ar.4
prevented his sending her back to Butte
to face the charge that her husband
wanted to -bring against her there.
Little Jeaiinette. the child in the case,
was taken from this city about January
1. unknown to tlia mother. Mrs. Cowan
had filed a suit for divorce on December
19 and asked for the custody of the child
Cowan, who is a nurse by profession, did
not care to accept the court's decision as
to who should have possession of Jean
nette. and taking advantage of a moment
when the mother relaxed her watchful
ness fled with the child to Butte. The
whereabouts of Cowan and his daughter
was unknown to the mother until a ehort
time ago, although she suspected, from
the fact that Cowan had a 6lster In Butte,
that he bad gone there. She verified her
euspicion and after consultation with her
mother determined to regain possession
of her little one.
Mrs. Cowan did not care to travel to
Butte alone on such a mission, so a pri
vate detective was employed to accom
pany her. When Butte was reached,
however, the private detective got drunk.
This led to his arrest, and he told the of
?icers all about why he was in their city
and how Mrs. Cowan intended stealing
the child. Cowan was notified and a
watch was kept on his sister's house,
where Jeannette had been placed.
In this extremity Mrs. Cowan resolved
to call on a distant relative, a wealthy
mining man of Butte, for assistance. He
at once took up her cause and chartered
a special car for her use, which he or
dered to have in waiting at the depot.
Then one evening he had Mrs. Cowan go
to the house where the child was and
ring the bell. No one answered and the
mother went in. Â£he came out with Jean
nette and hurried away In the night to
the car that awaited her.
As *;oon as the disappearance of the
little girl was discovered an alarm was
given and Cowan swore out a warrant for
his wife's arrest on the ground of abduc
tion. The police made a vigorous search
for her. but Mrs. Cowan managed to es
cape In her special car at 3 o'clock. Tele
grams were sent to the officers along the
line by the Butte Chief of Police asking
them to watch for and arrest the daring
mother. Seventy miles from Butte a
Sheriff went through the train, and rec
ognizing Mrs. Cowan from the descrip- '
tions took her into custody. The train
sped en and Mrs. Cowan and her child
were left behind. The mother pleaded
with the Sheriff, and falling to regain her
liberty that way declared to him that she
was rightfully in possession of the child,
and that if he did not let her go she would
make trouble for him. The Sheriff finally
agreed to let her go her way. She took
the next train for San Francisco, arriving
safely. She now has her child concealed
In this city and will continue to keep It
unless Cowan succeeds in securing the
custody of it through procoss of law.
Mrs. Cowan is the daughter of the late-
Colonel Tolles. at one time Recorder of
Ban Bernardino County. He was promi
nent in his section of the State. She mar
ried Cowan In ISSS.
