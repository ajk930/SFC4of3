''Washing-ton, the chief cf a nation In arms, doing

spiracy; serene against the open, foe before him, and
th.Â« darker energies at his back; "Washington, inspiring
order and spirit Into troops hungry and in rags, stung
by ingratitude, but betraying no anger, and ever ready

WHAT sert ef a man was that
George Washington, who, bora
at Popes Creek, Va., on Febru.
ary 22, 1722. and dying at Mount
Vernon en December U. 1799,
played In the meantime a part
fee potential that his nataa remains after
the lapse of a hundred years the mightiest
In our history? There Is a story told of
the late James Parton that aome forty
years ago he went to Virginia to. gather
material for a life ef the first President,
tÂ» be Issued by the house ef Harper. At
the aad of a fortnight ha returned to May
York, sought the office of his publishers
and said, quizzically:
'"Twon't do, friend Harper; another
bubble's burst. I can't write the life of
Washington, at least from the letters an-1
records and traditions placed at my dis
posal in Fairfax County."
"Why not? What Is the reason?" asked
James Harper, to whom few things were
Impossible.
"Simply because I have a wife and fam
ily to support, and because I don't want
to see a mob of enraged patriots sack and
destroy your publishing establishment ani
hang me to a lamp post."
"Explain yourself," cold the surprised
publisher.
"Well, the fact is." Mr. Parton went on,
"that Washington, Illustrious character a.%
he was and ever will be in history, was
no saint. He was wise and prudent in
council, brave and skillful in battle, dig
nified in demeanor and he brought tlie
colonies through their troubles. But he
went to cockfights and horseraces and bet
on both; was bo close In his money af
fairs as to be almost penurious; was hard
in his dealings with his neighbors; never
genial or generous toward his tenanta and
Inferiors; and some of his outings were â
well, I am afraid they would net have re
ceived the approval of the president of a
village temperance society." Â¦
"Enough said," interrupted Mr. Harper.
"On second â¢ thought, I agree with you,
Brother Parton, that we don't wane an
other life of' Washington."
For. the vast, majority^of his country
men Washington has always been land is
now a man so great and good as to be
devoid of all minor human defects, fault
less'as a status and. one might add. aa
cold. Marshall, Spark*. Irving and the
rest of his early biographers have all
brought their here down ta posterity Â«*
Btllts, rarely If ever allowing his huge feet
to touch the ground.
On the other hand certain recent writ
ers of history, In a praiseworthy effort to
rescue Washington's personality from the
fast deepening mist of legend, have gone
to the other extreme and have convinced
themselves, as they would now convince
us, that the most illustrious of Americans
was a man of obstinate will and only
commonplace ability, and burdened be
sides with more than the average man's
chare of the frailties of his kind.
Attentive study of the more than SOOO of
Washington's letters available to the stu
dent will convince one that' the truth
about him lies between the two estimates
indicated. .
If a man's relations toward his wife and
mother be a test of his manhood and no
bility the test is one splendidly sustained
by Washington. He was a dutiful, con
bJderate and loving son; his union with
Martha Custls proved a wise and happy
one. Their marriage was probably not an
affair of the heart with either of them.
When they met the days of romance were
over for both, but they were fitted for one
another, and although Washington's let
ters to his wife were destroyed by her
there Is not lacking abundant proof that
they grew together as time went on, and
that each never failed to show for the
other . that consideration and respect
which are the best guarantees of marital
happiness.
'Mrs. Washington had always at heart
the happiness and comfort, of. her hus
band, while, of ' the many reoorded- in
stances of his tender. solicitude for. her
there Is none more' touching than that
connected with his last illness. Attacked
suddenly and seriously after midnight.
Washington's malady was at least hast
ened tar his uawilllngneas that his wile
Â¦hould Incur the risk of a cold by rising
during, the bitter winter night to relieve
hla Bufferings. However, It may be noted
In passing that Washington, like many
other men, found It difficult to live under
the same roof with a mother-in-law. At
one time he Invited his wife's mother to
make Mount Vernon her home, but In a
eubsequent letter declared that he would
never again have two women In hla house
when he was there himself.
His hospitality Â¦was open-handed and
lavish, and his acts of charity wise, gen
erous and unceasing. He kept one crib of
corn on each of his plantations for the
poor, and- during one year of scarcity he
actually bought corn for $1 a bushel for
free distribution. He also maintained a
boat and seine for the use of hla neigh
bors, and stnt a market cart to Alexan
dria three times a week to get money for
his charities. However. Washington
brooked no Interference with his private
plans and permitted no interference with
his rights, be they of person or property.
On the other hand, he gave equal consid
eration to the rights of others, and. when
he found himself in the wrong was always
brave enough to make acknowledgment of
the fact.
Washington was once asked If the report
waa true that one of his slaves had run.
away, taking with him certain Important
papers. "Sir," said he sternly, "I. never
had a slave run away,", and that. Judged
by the standard of his time, he was a moat
humane master, is evident to any one who
reads hla many letters to the . superinten
dent of bis estate during- tho years 'of his
enforced j absence. . Food In plenty, good
clothing, care In Illness, harvest rum, sea
sonable gifts, with moderate tasksâ all
these were insisted upon again and again.
But he approved of the whip as s> last
resort with aa unruly slave.
When Washington once told John ilar
Â¦hall that ha had been making personal
sacrifices for the pabUo all his Ufa, ha
but spoke the truth.
He refused to accept pay for his mili
tary services, keeping an account of him
yarsooai expenditure* with tha accuracy
of a bank cashier, yet declining to aocMpC,
a cent from Congress beyond It, though
ho waa often pressed for money and ha 4

ladies in London received scant encouragement
from their sisters over here, and the news of a
subsequent formation of themselves into an execu
tive and a general committee to carry out the en
terprise was received with indifference. No one
in America is indifferent to-day. On the con

finally he overcame the mechanical dIT.
c-ulties and could give true expression to
his artistic feelings.
M. Felu is acknowledged the greatest
copyist of Van Dyke. Artists have eailol
the seven teas over to sit in the shadow
of Van Dyke's masterpieces; they have
worked early and late to .catch a glimpse
of the soul of the paintings and transfer
lt to their own canvases. But one hss
caught that elusive "something" that 1^
lngTalned In all originals and mocks nn4
refuses to be caught by the copyist. Aai
that one was M. Charles Francois Fein,
& painter who with his feet has succeedei
where men blessed with arms and nands
have failed. , ,
M. Felu painted Van Dyke "en rap
port" with the great master himself, for
his work has so nearly caught the genius
of the master's that only a connoisseur cf
rreat artistic discernment can tell ai
original Van Dyke from one of Felu's cop
ies.
This armlPFs wonder has also succeeded
!n copying other masters viith rare sym
pathy, but it is his Van Dyke copies that
have won him the greatest praise from
the hlprhest F.ourcf-s. However, his fame
does not rest on these alone. M. Felu's
original paintings are wonderfully beau
tiful in coloring and with something of
the chastened sorrow of the artist per
vading them and lifting them hijjh above
Miss Helen, because they met M. Ftlu
while living in Antwerp, and. like all Oth
ers who have had the privilege of know-
Ing him, they learned to admire ths niaa
even more than the painter.
It was Miss Helen Cashman who cour
teously admitted a Sunday Call reporter
and artist. Miss Cashman kindly consent
ed to allow the painting photographed,
and while the artist was busy doing this
she told many interesting recollections of
M. Felu.
"I shall never forget the first time I
saw M. Felu," said Miss Cashman.
"I was a little girl at the time,
probably 7 or 8 years old. Mamma
and I wore walking- down one
of the principal streets of Antwerp
when a kindly-faced gentleman stoppe-i
up, spoke to mamma and smiled at >ne.
With childish curiosity I could scarcely
wait until he had passed to ask mamma
why his sleeves were tucked in his coat
In that peculiar limp manner. You can
Imagine how startled I was when told that
the gentleman was armless.
"We were bhortly to leave Antwerp, and
a, day or two after this we mot M. Felu
by arpointmpnt and with him went to
visit his studio. My mother and father
had known M. Kelu for some time and
had often been in his studio, but this was
my first visit. Child though I was, the
whole scene is as fresh in my memory as

the hospital ship â a big sum, which was raised
within three zveeks â and the biggest slice was con
tributed as the result of that famous concert given
at Cloridgc's Hotel, London, on November 18,
which was planned and brought to a successful
issue mainly by Lady Randolph Churchill and her
associates of the committee.
Money poured into the. coffers, and just in the
nick of time the efforts of the ladies were nobly
seconded by tJie Atlantic Transport Company,
which gave the American steamship Maine to be
used as a hospital ship. Within a very short time
the vessel was fully equipped with supplies for
the nucleus of the fund. That of Lady Randolph
Churchill is a copy of a drawing of her recently
made by John Sargent and used in the famous
programme.

) Amazing stories are told about this fish.
About the year 800 two Arabian travelers
)spread the news that they had seen in In
dia a fish which was not only able to walk
)on land, but which also delighted to climb
cocoanut trees to extract and drink tha
'milk from the nuts, after which It return
ted to the water. Those who hoard the
story thought this mode of progression
(and this kind of diet were very stranga
tor a fish, and it is not aurprlsing that thÂ«
! Arabian travelers were generally regard
ed as Munchauscns.
\ Nine hundred years later, however, a
similar fish story cropped up again, and
las the narrator was well known as a
scientist, his words earned considerable
weight.
Climbing Fish of India.
Two wonderful fish have Just died at tha
Zoological Garden In London. They wera
specimens of the so-called climbing fish,
and were recently Imported from their naÂ«
'tlve country. India. They were the first
ever brought to Europe and their speedy
'death seems, proof that the climate did

the slightest difficulty and the colors
mixed with perfect ease. The palette was
held by the left great toe. which was
passed through the orifice like a thumb.
With the other foot he used his brushes,
laying on the tints with astonishing con
ndence and firmness.
"M. Felu had a slight cough that day
and I held my breath in suspense won
dering how he would get his handkerchief.
Quite naturally he passed hla rlghi foot
under the left knee and withdrew It from
as daintily as is possible with hands. I
have been told that he always used a
knife and fork at meals, cutting up his
own dinner and until very :ate In life
Bhaved himself without accident.
"We were with M. Felu that day over
an hour and during the time he played
mine host, doing with his feet little cour
tesies In a most charming way. To me
the most wonderful thing about M. Felu
was the manner In which he did things
with his feet without in the slightest Ã¼b
grree shocking .you. You simply forgot
less wonders doing tricks, but they made
one shudder and grow cold. There was
nothing of this about M. Felu. I was a
child and so would have been especially
susceptible had there been anything
weird about his actions.
"I have gone over the whole scene time
and again. I shall never forget his re
fined; intelligent face and kindly words.
There was a gentle dignity about him
that wiped out the incongruity of ifslng
his feet.
"Having known the man, we especteJly
prize this painting. I believe M. Felu
was near 70 when he died, and I am sure
all Belgium mourns his death. "We our
selves were grieved and shocked at tha
news of his death. I am sure his dying
hours must have been as calm and beau
tiful as his life."

When looking at the picture painted by
this extraordinary man it Is quite Im
possible to realize that lt was dona by

drawing and so well is the color laid.
Felu told an intimate friend that one
of his earliest recollections was sitting

him to grasp with his baby toes the

at first a source of great grief, but his
parents gradually realized that he had
unusual talents that more than compen
sated his physical deficiencies.
He was given the beat education and
graduated in letters with high honors.
Circumstances prevented M. Felu's tak
ing an expected official position In Ghent.
With Joy hs turned attention to art,
which had Ml ways attracted him. begin
ning the study of painting at Antwerp
when already 23 years old.
In all M. Felu has copied some hun

Majesty, the Queen Regent of Spain,
sought one. of M. Felu's pictures In 1535,
sent him the cross of a chevalier of the
Order of Christ of Portugal.
Those who knew him say that the deeds
of M. Felu placed him beyond tho pale
of pity. Ho Inspired those who came
within the radius of hia personality to
better and bigger work. Besides hl3
paintings, this wonderful man wrote a
number of versea of literary mprtt and
composed several comedies, one of which,
was played In Antwerp with great suc
cess.
The world has lost Monsieur Charles
Francois Felu and the half of the world
that loves art and "the half that applauds

the fruitful life of this armless painter
teaches will live on forever. Surely hU

"I am glad you have come to see me."
said Mrs. Abbott. The voice was pitched
high for weakness, but there was a tone
of the Old South ringing somewhere even
through its faintness.
"It is so seldom nny one comes down
here that I greatly enjoy the call 3 of
those who find tho walk pleasant. Will
you not be sealed?" she added.
Why did she add It? We were already

did not see.
"The welcome that we can give a vis

"And you arc a Kentucklan?"
"I was born one, and although I left i
my old home when a little girl, I love :
Kentucky still and am proud to claim it i
as my State."
"Your home was near a historical re- ;
glon," I remarked, edging toward the
point.
"My family was a historical family,"
she replied, moving openly toward it.
"And the family was"
"That of Martha Washington.
"Martha Washington, you remember,
was the daughter of one John Dandridge, ,
a Southern planter. He had another
daughter named Mary. That Mary was :
my grandmother. (
"I know of the Dandridge Bisters only
by report, for I was taken away from the
South when I 'was a very little girl. And ,
Martha, of course, aied eighteen years
before ray birth. '
"In those days I was Minerva Connor.
Father took hia little Minerva with him
when he moved from Kentucky to Illi
nois, where he became one of that State's
first settlers. I suppose I was taken to
say a well-regulattd good-by to my
grandmother and aunts, but that I do
not remember.
"When father went to Illinois' It wa3
considered the unsettled West. We left
the world behind us. Communication
with friends and relatives was of rarest
occurrence. ,
"Those who were near and dear to us
passed away as the years went on. and
often we did not hear of the deaths un
til long after. I grew to womanhood and
married and became the mother of seven
children, and the old home people did not
know of It. There are no such separa
tions In these days of steam and tele-,
graph, but ' the world was smaller then.
"Why, I wonder should I say there are
no such separations?" she broke off. "I.
who live here year In and year out and
meet only Mr?. Vivian arid a few neigh
bors? This place is lonely as only moun
tain homes know how to be lonely. But
the train passes near â I can hear it and
smell the smoke sometimes when I walk
out a little way. So I feel as If the world
were within reach.",

1 for a home?" I asked, looking about the
j cabin. Its walls and floor were bare, its

moved to California for a change of air.

a whole story. in that little sentence, but
I could not ask for It.
"For a while we lived near Folsom. My

+"A Jf ERIEL STANLEY is a singular instance of
I\y I the natural woman still surviving in our
V < I midst. And the natural woman is at war with
# JL our civilization. I never see poor Meriel
without an inner shudder, when I think of the
ends to which fate and her own temperament must in
evitably hurry her. That shapely brown neck, straight
and firm as a column, is all too delicate for a rope. Yet
a rope it will be, or I am no true prophet.
When I say that Meriel is a natural woman I mean
what I say, for good and for evil. See her leaning her
elbows on the gate that leads from Sir Walter's copse
out on to the heather-clad moorland â a tall, lithe fig
ure, with keen brown face, eager wistful eves, and
wealth of black hair just peeping from beneath her
pink-and-white sun-bonnet â a bronzed woman of the
pcopl:, quivering with suppressed emotion to the tips
of the fingers â and you can guess at once the salient
points of her character. Hers is the impassioned teri
peran:er.t, embodied in a sound and vigorous frame;
take her as a specimen of the natural woman, a savage
still at heart, but a savage of the best type, capable of
great love, great revenge, great devotion, great self
sacrifice, gÂ£eat crimes, great repentances, but not of
anything mean or small or commonplace.
The savage has in him, in the germ, all that the best
end worst among civilized men have developed separ
atelyâexcept one thing, consistency. He can rise to
splendid heights of generosity, and sink to vile depths
t&f cruelty and thame; but all is momentary; what he
cannot encompass is sustained action or sustained feel
ing. He is a creature of moral impulses, for good or
bad. The passing mood, the passing emotion, sway
him. And Meriel is like that. She can love: she can
hate; but she cannot be steadily or persistently any
thing.
In spite of her strange name she is hot a gipsy. At
least not consciously. Much gypsy blood lurks unknown
in the wild region of Dorset, where the Stanleys live,
and Meriel has associated with gypsies and poachers
from her childhood upward. She can even "patter
Rommany" a little, though only as an outsider; but her
people have long been settled in this district, and if ever
they were members of the Stanley clan, have forgotten
it long ago in all save their surname. As to her fantastic
Christian name, Meriel, that came to her from an aunt,
who inherited it in turn from five generations of female
ancestors. Meriel was christened by that name, though
the clergyman who baptized her tried hard to modernize
and vulgarize it into Muriel; but the mother stood up
str-"t!v nrrpjnst such new-fangled nonsense. '"Twas al
ways Meriel with the Stanleys and the Tibbalds," she
siii-j, with true pride of race, "ever since I heard tell of
'cm; my maid shall be Meriel, passon will it or passon
nill it." And Meriel she was from that day onward.
It may surprise you to learn that Meriel was ever
christened at all; for when she was a bairn the nearest
church to Greydown was at Upton Parva, seven long
miles across the moor as the crow flies; and the people
of Greydown in those days recked little in most ways of
churches and parsons. "They were a barbarous folk up
here, zur," Meriel's father said to me one day, in a
rare burst of loquaciousness, for he is a silent man. "I
don't suppose you'd 'a found a more barbarous folk
anywheres in England, go forty years back, than the
Greydown people." And he was quite right. The hill
itself stands mainly in Dorset, but it lies at the upper
end of three river valleys, and at the junction of three
shires: so for ages it was the refuge of all the evpsies.
the horse-copers, the sheep-stealers. the poachers, the
miscellaneous riff-raff and outlaws of the neighborhood.
Nowadays their descendants for the most part are hon
estly occupied in broom-making and basket-weaving:
but they do not take readily to steady labor, preferring
to be free and to be their own masters â a natural taste
which I confess I share with them. Nevertheless, even
in their worst days of barbarism, the Grevdowners al
ways christened their children in church, and were mar
ried by parson â not that they attached much religious
Importance to the rite to either case, btrt they Iflced the
importance of it; that was the regular authorized way
of doing things, and they would wish the settled folk
down yonder at Upton to know that the Greydowners
were every bit as good Christians any day as they were.
Because you are a broomsquire, that is no valid reason
why you shouldn't behave like other civilized gentle
folk.
"Then you really were christened, Meriel?" I said to
her once, interrogatively. And she answered. . half
laughing, "Yes, I was christened all right, zur: but I
don't suppose it took." And I think she was' right, for
a verier pagan than Meriel Stanley it would be hard to
light upon. As a girl she grew up on this high moor
land, running about shoeless and stockingless among
the gorse and heather, and trapping leverets, and
browning her shapely legs with paddling in the ponds
after newts and tadpoles. To this day she can tickle
trout against any man in Dorsetshire. Her father's cot
tage lay among tall bracken in a valley of bottom. just
below the gibbet â that gibbet on which the murderers
of the warfaring woman were hung in chains a hundred
years_ ago, and which long remained a terror and a
warning to evildoers, the sole symbol of civilization, re
pressive civilization, in these lonely uplands. You can
tell the cottage from others about by the climbing red
roses and by the great stacks of dry heather piled out
side the door and waiting to be made up into farmhouse
brooms such as are used for rough work in yards and
stables. Before Meriel was io years old she knew as
much about jays and weasels and hawks and foxes as
Sir Walter's gamekeeper. She could show you the
mottled brown eggs of the night-jar, lying loose on .the
bare ground without nest or shelter; she could find the
wren's callow young and the baby stoats in the copse;
she had observed at what age the soft little hedgehogs
begin to get their prickles hardened, and where the
woodcock probed with their long,- straight bills after
grubs and worms in the soft, spongy moss of the peat
logged hollows. At 18 she was tall and beautiful, with
wild unkempt hair; hair long and black and straight and
wiry, without a suspicion of curl in it, recalling, per
haps, the remote Indian blood of her gypsy ancestor:?,
once Jats of the Punjaub. A handsomer girl of her
v/ayward peasant type I have seldom seen. Let me try
to describe her.
Meriel's head is shapely and well poised on the shoul
ders â a trait which you will find almost always accom
panies the impassioned character. Her neck is erect,
and she carries herself proudly. The pose reminds me
at. times of the portraits of Dante. And indeed. tKough
it may sound orld to compare this wild English moor
land girl with the proud, sardonic Tuscan poet. I can
recognize in essence ?. certain community of type be
twecn the two. Her eyes are dark and shy. but with
sudden flashes in them. The eyebrows and eyelids are
black and abundant. Her long, straight hair flows down
on her shoulders when loosed â as it often is â or else
is gathered up into a great careless bunch at the back of
the head, with folds covering the cars, which recai!
Charlotte Bronte. For, bar unessentials, Meriel is iust a
Charlotte Bronte, undeveloped. Her features are some
what large, but soft in outline; her chin stronc; her
mouth has sensuous, thick lips, redeemed by the ex
quisite curve, like a Rosetti portrait. The hands are lone
and slender; the fingers have a curious tremulous move
ment; the whole emotion of the woman conies out in
them at times, as it comes out in her heaving bosom,
her flashing eye, her close-set lips, her strange, wistful
expression. She impresses me always as vaguely long
ing for something above her â something she has never
known and never will know â something from which her
class and her lack of education forever divide her.
You must know Meriel pretty well indeed before
you begin to suspect how much there is in her. Like
most people of intensely passionate natures, she is not
given to speech: her thoughts and feelings lie too
deep for words; and even if her pride did not .prevent
her from saying at all times what she feds, her mere
lack of vocabulary would suffice to keep her from vol
uble self-revelation. Nor is she by any means demon
strative. It is an error to suppose that emotional na
tures are necessarily given to expressing their emotion
cither in words or gestures. The exact opposite would
be truer. Emotion hides itself. Meriel's manners are
quiet and reserved; she is not fitful cr restless: you
cannot often sec how profoundly she is thinking or feel
ing; only at rare moments does some accident reveal
the real depth of her nature. Once I caught her at
sunset by the two-step stile that leads from the moor
into the lammas fields. She did not hear me coming.
I crept up behind her, admiring her lithe form. ?il
houtted against the red sky, as she leaned on the stile
and gazed at the crimson and orange clouds before her]
When I drew quite near she turned round with a short
sigh. To my surprise I saw she had tears in her eyes.
"That's a beautiful sky, Meriel," I said. She clasped
her hands and answered, "Oh, beautiful, beautiful! A
sky like that makes one cry, zur, doan't it?" Then, as
if she had let herself go too much, she turned and fled,
like the wayward, forest-haunting thing she is. For a
Snpnth af:er, whenever she saw me. she seemed to slink
on one side, as if ashamed of having let herself be dis
covered in the act of admiring nature.
A girl of so deeply emotional a temperament could
hardly grow up without loving much Â«nd loving often.
The full wealth of her soul could only expend itself on
those she loved profoundly. Even as a child. I remem
ber, she used to creep out of the cottage on summer
nights and go to a spot in the copse where the badger
nested; there the badger cubs would steal out. unde
terred by the presence of that other wild creature, and
play clumsily with their mother in the sober twilight;
Â«;nd Meriel adopted one and loved it, as other children
would love a dog or a pigeon. The choice was signifi
cant. That sympathetic heart could waste its affection
on the veriest bear; perhaps it was well, for what sort
of men could poor Meriel hope to captivate among the
chairmenders and basketmakers of her wild moorland
home? It is not the man that the woman really loves â
especially such impassioned women as this â it is the
ideal she makes of him. And a passionate character
like Meriel's will erect a golden image of some game
keeper or some groom and bow down to it in secret as
devotedl}- and earnestly as a lady will bow down to her
dissolute dragoon or her worthless, drunken cross
country rider. Idealism works this miracle â it is easy
to idealize a laborer or a navvy as an insipid curate or
a sneering stockbroker.
When Meriel was 16 her passion was for the footman
at the great house in the valley â the footman with the
blue livery and padded calves, who spent half the year
at the town house in Mayfair and half at Greydown.
Not that she ever told her love; it is not the way of
girls like Meriel to wear their hearts upon their sleeves.
I doubt if anybody save myself who am a novelist by
trade and therefore observant of these little signs of
emotion, ever so much as guessed it. But day after day,
when Alfred was about, Meriel would hover near the
gate of the great house, waiting and watching, amply
repaid if the hero of her young love came out on his
way to the village on some errand and gave her a pass
ing nod and a "Good day, young woman." She gloated
over his livery, I feel sure; gloated over it with the ad
miration which an Earl's daughter feels for a hero's uni
form. But Alfred went away some months later "to
better himself at Brighton, and after mourning him for
six weeks Meriel fell a victim to the charms of the stal
wart young policeman who arrested Ted Vaughan for
causing incendiary heath fires at- Highdown Firs. This,
of course, was sheer treason to her class; family honor
intervened: Septerius Stanley, her father, was the friend
and associate of gypsies and poachers and tramps and
horse-stealers; he could hardly let. his daughter consort
FOR THOSE WHO WEAR RINGS
IT is doubtful whether the origin of the custom of
wearing a ring as a symbol of marriage has ever
been established beyond dispute. It is certain, how
ever, that the custom is an ancient one, for in the
Bible may be found several references to rings, and the
Christians used the ring as a symbol. of marriage in Bgo.
Regarding the custom of wearing the wedding rin:^
on the most useless finger of the left hand â the third
finger â the explanation has been made that the helpless
ness of that finger is a protection to the ring, as on the
weakest finger it" is preserved from rough usage. An
other reason given is that on the third finger there is a
vein leading from the heart, hence the same excuse as
that given for shaking hands with the left hand â "nearer
the heart."
In olden times kings and others in authority wore on
the ring a seal or image that indicated power, and in
the time of Moses the priests wore rings' as' symbols of
office. In the British Museum quaint rings, made of
porcelain, which once adorned'the fingers of the poorer
classes in Egypt, may be seen.
Among the Jews the ring is an important factor in
the marriage ceremony, and in Germany the husband U
expected to wear his marriage ring continuously. In
fact, it would be a difficult matter for a man to re-estab
lish harmony in his home were he discovered to have
removed the symbol of marriage from his finger, the in
ference being that he had been trying to conceal the fact
of his marriage.
Queen Victoria possesses many rings, but three of
these have a special value, in view of the history con
nected with them. One is her wedding ring â a narrow
gold band. The second is her bethrothal ring, a snake
made of emeralds, and the third is a diamond ring given
to her by Prince Aibert when she was a young girl.
Queen Elizabeth, who was noted for her love of
jewelry, wore many rings. The Emperor of Germany
is another royal personage who has displayed a liking
for rings. It is said that on all important occasions
the Kaiser will be seen to wear oh his left hand a mas
sive gold ring set with a large dark stone. The ring is
credited with heing an heirloom of the Hohenzollern
family and came into the possession of Margraf Ulrich
away back in the thirteenth century. After a series of
adventures and mishaps the ring became the property of
the Kaiser, who, although not a superstitious man, is
never seen on occasions of state and importance with
out the ring.
Rings have been fashioned from every material of suf
ficient strength to be put to such use. including gold,
silver, steel, brass, iron, bronze, ivory, jet, earthenware
and wire.
Curious instances have been cited where makeshift
substitutes for the conventional wedding ring have been
utilized during the marriage ceremony. One such, occa
sion occurred some time ago in a nearby town, when
the ring was missing. Nothing better being available
as a substitute, a curtain ring was used, and on still an
other occasion the ring handle of the church key waj
utilized.
uncensured with a mere policeman. And the young po
liceman himself was not likely to care for so disreput
able a connection. In the essence of things, it is true.
Meriel was as far above him as a poetess is above an
ordinary young city man; but the essence of things, I
fear, counts for little or nothing in matrimonial matters.
Meriel had to give up her stalwart policeman and con
sole herself later on with Ted Vaughan himself, when
that noble young savage came gayly out of prison.
But every man and every woman has one great love
in a lifetime, and after many lesser trial trips Meriel
Stanley found hers at last in Joe Arundel. the poacher.
You may laugh; but I can tell you an affection like
Meriel Stanley's is no laughing matter: the fact that she
could idealize a great hulking rowdy and bully like Joe
is in itself a strong proof of the woman's deep poetic na
ture. Outwardly, tranquil of demeanor, a dreamer - and
brooder, Meriel has yet a profound admiration such as
the natural woman always feels for the man of courage
and the man of action. Do you remember Homer's
Andromache? She is the" true type of the impassioned
woman of these lower grades and lower races â the
woman who can love and endure much, to whom crime
â¢and bloodshed are but natural attributes of the hero she
worships. Hector Had attacked the town where An
dromache lived, had sacked and burned it. and slain her
father and mother and had carried her off as his wife
after the primitive mode" of "marriage by capture." And
did Andromache hate him for those deeds of violence
with all. her soul? Not a bit of it: she accepted such
little episodes as part of the established order of things
and clung to her Hector and loved and cherished him.
and worshiped him with a worship passing that of the
willing chooser. "But, Hector," she says to him in
that immortal passage which has stirred the hearts or
a thousand generations, "but. Hector, thou to me art
father and mother, and thou to me beloved husband."
Meriel Stanley is a survivor of barbarism cast in the
same mold. She could have worshiped the man who
stole her from her home and slew her parents, if only
he had the qualities she could respect and idealize
Now Joe Arundel, "the poacher, was the whispered
terror of his own neighborhood: from childhood no
Meriel had heard sli her own set admire and describe
with glowing praise the bold acts of this brave and sul
len desperado. Joe had been three separate times in
prison â a proud distinction; he was even eravely sus
pected of having murdered the gamekeeper, whose
corpse was found wrapped up in faded leaves at the bot
tom of the chestnut copse by Dolman's Hollow. Toe
did not admit the impeachment, but neither did he re
ject it: he tossed his head and looked arrogant when
ever the subject was alluded to in his presence. Too
proud to deny, he was too cautious to boast. Meriel
would stand by and admire him silently. It was not
Meriel's way to be demonstrative either of affection or
admiration: only by the quick twitch in her bloodless
fingers, by the knitted brow, by the eyes steadily fixed
on her chosen hero, could one tell how immense was
her admiration for the man who had defied the whole
banded power of the law and the country, and exposed
himself to the risk of a rope for his last portion. " Her :
fists would clench themselves till the nails dug into the
palms and almost drew blood v.-hile Joe talked in dark
hints of some' little brush with Sir Walter's keepers, or
vaguely alluded with picturesque mistiness of thought
and language to some fight with the police over :i
brace or two of pheasants. For. brought up as she had
â¢been, passionate rebelliousness was almost a necessary
feature of Meriel Stanley's character. She hates law
and order with the natural hatred of a hunted creature:
what have they ever done for her and hers save harry
them into prison or hound them to the workhouse?
The gentry in her eyes arc so many oppressors of her
wild, free kind; they would drive all the world from the
heath and the copse into service or the factories.
Meriel wants none such. For her, the open moor and
the wide air of heaven !
Joe for his part did not readily discover that Meriel
was in <-love with him: Joe is not by nature an intui
tive creature: he can read the tracks of bird and beas f .
in the snow far more easily than he can reid the marks
of human feeling or human passion. And Meriel is not
the sort of girl to fling herself at any man. She falls
in love, it is true, easily and rapidly: her passions have
the barbaric quickness and certainty. Almost at 'sight,
she says "I love that man,", or "I do not." But she
says iti to herself 'alorie. "Torture would not draw frorol
her the overt>confession. In that, once more, she is a
thoroughgoing savage. Your savage woman loves des
perately, but in silence. She is coy and wayward. She
flies like a squirrel from him who pursues, and then
turns and smiles â not because she wishes to escape, but
because Vome deep instinct of her race teaches her that
to fly is the proper part of woman: ; But I could see
from an early point in this growing passion how Meriel
was letting her love for Joe swallow up her entire na
ture. She would sit on the logs by her father's house
when Joe came round, with her strong, small chin
poised on her open hand, and listen while Toe talked to
Septerius Stanley, as rapt as if Joe's few jerky inarticu
late sentences were the purest flower of human elo
nuence. Did ever man talk like Joe? Did ever man loo:<
like him? Six feet twoâ though a trifle hulkintr and
shambling in gait. I must admit, with a scar on the left
cheek won in open fight with those oppressors of the
human race, the police: and with courage enough to go
on to the bitter end. till fate landed him at last in that
lofty position in death he was bound to occupy. Merie!
â¢ looped and sighed. He was a king among poachers.
Night after night she would creep out by the copses
where Toe might be found, and as he skulked oast her
with his blear-eyed ferret would suggest to him casually
in n, careless voice where the best pheasants were likely
to be found, or point out which path the keeper had
last taken on his evening round through the chestnut
plantation. She knew as much of woodland lore as Toe
himself, I fancy, and Joe accepted her hints with an
graceful country awkwardness. Still, he thought her
"a knowing one," and told her so sometimes. Meriel's
brown cheek flushed red through the russet at words of
praise from her hero's lips. Anybody but a foo! or
Joe â would have known she was in love. But Toe.
though a sharp hand at a trap or a net. is not remark
able for the-quickness of his instincts.
At last one evening as they stood together by ths
copse (the merry small rabbits gamboling all round
them, and the corncrake rattling). Meriel told him some
point she had observed about the hare's "forms" in the
heath â a new wrinkle even to the experienced poacher.
Joe gazed at her and smiled â smiled from ear to ear
with expansive appreciation. "Meriel, maaid." he sair!
slowly, with open mouth and hanging lip, '"cc do know
a thing or two, *cc do! There bain't dree maaid* or.
Greydown Hill knows as much as thee. maaid. If thes
an' me was to come together us 'ould do a good triad*
in the poachin', ouldn't us?"
Meriel's heart beat high, Meriel's cheek* flushed
crimson. He had recognized her at last, then: this
prince of men had spoken! She drew away a step or
two, with her quick, squirrel glance. "Doan't 'cc talk
like that, Joe," she said, and gave a little toss of ths
proud head â yet her voice tender. "I bain't one
of the men. They'm all deceivers."
It dawned acro>s Joe as she withdrew her face that
Meriel really liked him. Joe was a lady's man ia his
way, but his way was not Meriel's. He slipped his arm
round her waist. Meriel tried to evade him. thoush
'twas a formal evasion. The proud heart was won lonsr
ago. Tears stood in Meriel's eyes. Joe Artmdel had
chosen her!
After that they met nightly on the moor among tha
tall green gorse. or else in the copse where JoÂ« killed
the keeper. That thrill of romance and terror suited
Meriel's fancy well; slie felt about the copse as some
Homeric maiden of Uion might have felt about the
spot where her lover had slain in open fight a mighty
man among the Myrmidons. Educated and cultivated,
she would have wandered by herself and read Shelley
and Rossetti; as it was she stole off to meet Joe in the
copse which had been the. scene of his greatest and
most successful encounter with the despotic forces. By
and by she began to talk to him tentatively of mar
riage. Joe didn't think much of that â Joe was not ; >v
nature a marrying man ; he took it they might get along
well enough* by themselves without the passon and the
paJsoVs fees. But there Meriel's will was iron. All the
Stanleys from all time had been duly married in church,
and she wouldn't go back upon the tradition of the fam
ily. '"Passon to Upton Parva won't want to marry we."
Joe objected, grinning. "Then us can go to Exeter."
Meriel answered with grave earnestness, "but married I
will be, and to none but thee. Joe Ar'ndel." After that
Joe felt that there was naught for it but to give way. He
gave way with a bad grace, and entered a church for the
first timesincehis christening. "It pleases 'er an' it don't
hurt me," was the explanation he gave to his poaching
pals of his unsportsmanlike conduct. At the same
time he made it clearly understood that he did not mean
to let his new state seriously interfere with his manner
of living. "'â¢-â¢- I
Once married Menel went on loving her worthless
husband with the unvarying and incredible devotion of
an impassioned nature. Nothing he could do to her
seemed to alter her affection. Her man might come
home drunk and beat her; that was only natural; men
are built that way; and was it not to be expected that
a splendid creature like Joe â six feet two inches in hi 3
shoeless feet and broad-shouldered to mateh â should
knock about a weak woman who loved and admired
him? Meriel was no shrew. Souls capable of deep
feeling are seldom scolds. She endured it allâ and
worse â because it was Joe's pleasure. Her first baby
came. Meriel positively idolized it: her baby: Joe's
baby. I doubt if any child in the squire's nursery was
ever so much made of as the poacher's brown boy. with
his father's. eyes and black hair like his mother's. Not
that she talked of her little one much. Meriel never
talked much about anything that moved her inmost
soul. She had learned how to do without sympathy.
But one day as I passed her cottage in the glen she
was seated on a log outside the porch where red roses
clambered, holding out a foxglove spike to please her
baby. 'That's a fine boy, Meriel," I said, looking at
him. Tears came into her eyes once more. "Yes. he's
a tidy little man. zur," she answered, holding him uo to
be admired. "They do tell me he favors Toe." And
she said it as she might have said. "He resembles the
prince, his father." The fierce, suppressed earnestness
of her tone fairly touched me. ''I never saw a prettier
baby in my lilY T replied. She looked up at me. a
shy glance, with gratitude in her eyes, but she answered
nothing. Her thoughts were too deep for such words
as she knew. Only a poet could have uttered what was
passing within her.
I said at the beginning I conTd never see Meriel with
out an inner shudder at the fate which is in store for
her. What fate? you ask. Well, it seems to me inevit
able. I have a sort of premonition of the vcrv wav it
will come. Some day Joe will get into a quarrel with
some other man ribout n woman â the other man's wife
and Mend's rival. The two will fisrht. and the other
man. being quicker though less powerful than Toe. will
get him down and hold him. Then Mericl will rush in
to her faithless husband's aid and stab his assailant. She
would never stab her rival â she is too proud for that:
but she would stab the man who for her rival's sake
dared attack her hero. The rest follows of course. And
those who read the report of the trial in the papers
will on'y know that a poacher's wife, a very -bad lot. the
daughter and associate of criminals, was sentenced to
death for murdering a man with whom her good-for
nothing husband had been Quarreling. But I know all:
and in some dim way I can feel for poor Meriek

BY GRANT ALLENONE of the most lr.tereetlng shcrt
trips from Singapore is a visit to
Johore Bharu. the residence of H.
H. the Sultan of Johore, and the
capital of the state and territory
of Johore. It is situated at the extreme
Fouthern end of the Malay Peninsula and
la separated from the island of Singapore
by the narrow Straits of Tebrau (only one
and a quarter miles wide).
Johore is ruled over by a Sultan under
an English protectorate. The armed force
of this little kingdom consists of a regi
ment Â°f native troops, uniformed in dark
blue, with white helmets, and are very
well drilled.
The population i? composed of a few
whites, holding positions under the Sultan.
the masses being Malays and Chinee.
The religion is Mohammedan.
The pres*?nt Sultan only took the throne
within the past few years, on the death
cf his father. He received his education
In England, is now SS years of age, six
feet in height and *s quite good looking.
Well built and an athlete, he takes great
pleasure in all outdoor amusements, hav

where many a* hotly contested game tales
place among the subjects for trophies pre
sented by the Sultan.
He is also one of the twst whips in the
Kast. and maintains a large racing stable,
to which he gives his personal attention,
hip horses being among the finest and
faFietst in the country. He is an excellent

understand this thoroughly it is neces

tO it. :, : V., 'Â¦''Â¦:'Â¦':.
Goebel was convinced that the people of
Kentucky were paying an exorbitant toll
to cross the bridges over the Ohio River.
He determined. In pursuance of his cor
poration antagonism, to have the tolls re
duced. He introduced a bill in the Krn
tucky Legislature reducing the tolls to one
cent for each foot passenger. The meas
ure was bitterly opposed and a heated
fight ensued, which Goebel finally won.
Colonel John Sanford was a large stock
holder in one of the bridge companies and
was Intensely incensed against Goebel. He
wrote a long article and published it in a
Covington paper. In which he attacked
Goebel as the father of the bill In a scath T
Ing personal criticism. Goebel replied wJtn
an unsigned article that fairly broiled the
old soldier, and Sanford at once threat
ened to kill the author of the articSe on
sight if he ever learned his name.
Goebel at once claimed the authorship
of the letter, and both men carried ; .

ARE WE TO HAVE A TUNNEL CONNECTING OAKLAND WITH SAN FRANCISCO ?
WHE bill Introduced In Congress by
I Congressman Kahn providing for a
i I tunnel to be constructed under San
PI Francisco Bay between San Fran-
J^ cisco and Oakland revives an old
movement and agitation which held
the boards on Loth sides of the bay about
twelve years ago. At that time the project
of a tunnel under the bay was advanced
by Dr. Edward Parsons, an Englishman,
who represented v syndicate of English
capitalists who were disposed to under
take the construction of the tunnel as a
private enterprise. Dr. Parsons was a
bachelor, iivir.g in San Francisco, â¢where.
Indeed, he continued to reside until hia
death, about three years ago. The Idei
ct the tunnel eeems to have been flr?t
suggested by him, and was by him com
municated to the English parties. The
proposition was received with high favor
In London. At that time the English at
mosphere was pregnant with tunnel
projects on the Thames and Mer6ey and
tunneling the English Channel between
Dover Heights on the English elde and
Calais on tho French.
Dr. Parsona received encouragement
from his English friends and a route for
the tunnel was surveyed across the bay,
extensive borings were made in the ma
terial of the bay bottom along the pro
posed route and a long series of estimates
and computations were made upon the
cost of the work and the various features
of profit and expense.
The engineer employed on the work was
Julian Le Conte, now one of the United
States Government engineers on harbor
work. It waa he who selected the route,
directed the borings and drew detailed
plans of the proposed improvement. Mr.
Le Conte is firmly convinced to-day that
the scheme as worked upon Dr. Parsons
and himself Is perfectly practicable, pre
sents but few engineering difficulties,
would largely reward the Investment and
is in all the best large proposition In Cal
ifornia to-day. Mr. Le Conto does not
think practicable, however, the tunnel
proposed in the bill introduced by Con
gressman Kahn. This tunnel proposes to
connect the water front with the Oakland
Bide via Goat Island, using that as a sta
tion for ventilation and Â¦ other purposes.
The difficulty in such a project would be
the depth of the water of the bay along
the line.
This would be about a hundred and
thirty feet and would mean a weight on
top of the tunnel of about four tons to
the square foot, such a weight as no tun
nel could withstand; besides, the siope
down to the bottom level on both eldoa
of the bay would be too great. Further
more. It Is not likely that It is the char
acter of project that would como under
the province of the Government to take
up. It would not be a tunnel across the
border of two States, but one lying wholly
within one State, and with such internal
affairs of a State the general Government
does not concern Itself. Moreover, the
scheme being Injected Into Congren comes
against the full glare of the Huntington
Interest: and it Is likely that this force
if no other In the national council will
see that It is properly smothered.
The underbay tunnel is still a project
for private enterprise. Yet the measure
Introduced by Congressman Kahn sur
vives the asphyxiating Influences which
will assail it, it is likely that a survey
of the Government engneers of the har
bor of San Francisco, to whom the mat
ter will be referred, and of whom Mr. Le
Conte, as stated, Is one, will determine
that the tunnel which the Government
should build should be that of the Par
sons route and not of the Goat Island
route.
The proposed Parsons tunnel was five
miles In length and ran from a point, on
the San Francisco side west of Hunters
Point and east of Butchertown. across to
West Alameda. This tunnel would have
run under seven fathoms of water for
three miles nearest the San Francisco
side, and graded from three fathoms up
for two miles on the opposite side. Ap
proaching the San Francisco shore the
tunnel would have deflected somewhat
from the straight line, bending to the
west to avoid a deep sink of some fifteen
fathoms near Hunters Point; but for this
depression in the bottom, the line would
have be<3Q straight from West Alameda
to Hunters Point. This position across
the bay would have fixed uhe mouths of
the tunnel about three miles to the east
of the business center of San Francisco
and about two miles to the east of that
of Oakland; this, of course, would be un
desirable, It being much preferred that
the subway should start at the foot of
Market street if possible: but It was
found that the point selected was the
lowest place down on tho bay where the
water was shallow enough to admit of
the tunnel.
The cost of this work completed was
computed to be about one and a quarter
millions per mile, or about $6,250,000 in all.
It was calculated that the sum of seven
and a half millions of dollars would buy
all necessary lands, rights of way and
else, build the tunnel and lay and equip
all railroads needful as a part of the tun
nel system.
This money Dr. Parsons believed to the
day of his death he would be able to
raise, and year by year he kept working
on his scheme, corresponding with his
capitalists, planning, preparing and hop-
Ing. When electrical railroads came into
U3Â« their advent was hailed by him with
delight, for thereby he perceived an addi
tional and -forceful argument In behalf of
his project. Electrical railroads seemed
to Bolve many of the questions affecting
tunnel transportation. In the flrst place
the trains were much lighter than those
of steam roads, and hence did not Jar a
tunnel so much in passing through it: the
vibrations produced by train rumblings
of the earth have been known to cause
serious caves, and many tunnel disasters
which perplex the railroad officials as to
their causes have really had their origin
from these "train tremors."
Furthermore, an electrical railroad was
cheaper to build and equip than a steam
road and It could be operated at about
25 per cent less cost. But the great ad
vantage was that the problem of tunnel
ventilation was thereby solved. Ventil
ating a long tunnel used by locomotive
engines is the most baf!line of all diffi
culties with which the engineer has to
grapple. The engine is constantly throw
ing out smoke in the tunnel and this has
no ready means of escape. The conse
quence is that the air within soon be
comes vitiated and stifling. When the ris
ing incline is reached the engine must re
double its efforts and large quantities of
smoke and fumes are thrown out which
remain in 'the tunnel and float through
it. so if trains enter it frequently.. the air
becomes dangerous to breathe.
The length of the entire trip from Mar
ket street, San Francisco, to Broadway.
Oakland, would have been ten miles and
the trip accomplished in about the same
time that it takes a passenger by boat
and train at present. The passenger would
also have the advantage of a continuous
â¢ride without change of cars, and the trips
would have been at 15-mlnute intervals.
A very great advantage which the tunnel
would have presented over the boats
would have been no delays on account of
weather.
The great feature, however, presented
to the passenger by the tunnel would be
that of cheapness of fare. Fi\;e cents
would be the highest fare c.arged. Com
mutation tickets could be sold at 4 cents,'
with all punches good until used.
As Dr. Parsons' scheme was greatly
assisted by the tunnel sentiment In Eng
land growing out of the success of the
flrst borings of the English Channel tun
nel, so his project was marred by the
snuffing out of that work, which came
about as a Parliamentary matter. Tho
Interests which In England and Franca
would have been harmed by the construc
tion of the tunnel, when they caw nuch
a fact was possible from an engineering
standpoint, and remarked also that th*
financial backing behind the scheme was
ample to carry It to a .successful end, took
an entirely other tack In their fight
against it. They raised a hue and cry
that if the tunnel were built England
would be exposed to an invasion by
France in time of war, or, In fact, at any
time.
The panic won; the channel tunnel
was condemned by Parliament "on
strategic grounds." The magnificent
hand of commerce which would
have stretched across the jj channel
in five years was closed * Into a
flst- of war and shaken at Prance. When
this scheme fell a feeling of disgust per-*"
vaded the whole nation on all tunnÂ«>s
projects, and this reached even to Sanj
Francisco and lay coldly on the enterprise,
of Dr. Parsons. All the structure which*,
he had erected tending to the commence-;
ment of work fell to pieces; his English'
correspondents ceased to answer his let-_
ttrs. This continued for several years,
until the doctor went to England and
stirred things up
again, and the tun
nel project took a '
new lease of life. *fl\a
Just then, when it */flÂ«
was getting Into |
operation again, the tSUWISI
doctor died and the
great scheme was .
again snuffed out. (fl

He laid his plans well and never al
lowed anything to escape him. Every lit

and his plans rarely had to be altered by
succeeding events. If they were changed
what similar to thfct existing In the na-
tlonal Electoral College. The analogy con- <
sists In the creation of a central board. 1
which passes upon all election returns
and declares the results upon the returns J
which It' receives from the county boards 1
throughout the State. The difference is !
that the State Board appoints each of the '
County Boards, and County Boards In "
their turn appoint the election officers, so .
that the State Board can control the eleo- I

W be at all times master of the situ

Curious Old Wedding Customs.
The flrst silver wedding dates back to
the time of Hugues Capet. Two servants
belonging to him had grown gray in his
service, a man and a woman, and what
could he do as a reward? Calling the
woman he eaid: "Your service is great
greater than this man's, whose service Is
great enough, for the woman always finds
work harder than a man and, therefore.
1 will give you a reward. At your age I
know of none better than a dowry and a
husband. The dowry is hereâ this farm
from this time forth belongs to you. If
this man who has worked with you five
and twenty years Is willingto marry you
then the husband Is ready."
"Tour Majesty." said the old peasant,
"how is it possible that wÂ« should marry,
having already silver hairs?"
"Then It shall be a silver wedding," and
tRe King gave the couple silver enough
to Keep them In plenty. This soon became
known all over France and raised such en
thusiasm that it became a fashion after
twenty-five years of mar Tied live to cele
brate a silver wedding.
The practice of the wife assuming the
husband's name at marriage is a Roman
custom and originated soon after the Ro
man occupation. Julia married to Pompey
became "Julia of Pompey." In later time*
married women signed their names In the
same manner, but omitted the "of." How
ever, during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries the usage seems doubtful, sines
we find Catharine Parreo signing herself
after she had been twice married. In Ice
land the -opposite has always been tha
custom. There, after marriage, tho hus
band assumes the wife's name.
Our wedding cake is the remains of a
custom whereby a Roman bride held In
her left hand three wheat ears, and many
centuries later an English bride wor* a
chaplet of wheat. The bridesmaids threw
grains of corn or small bits of cake upon
the heads of the newly married, and tft*
guests picked up the pieces and ate them.
The wedding cake did not come Into gen
eral use until the last century, and was
then composed of solid blocks, laid to
gether, iced all over, so that when the
outer crust was broken over the bride's
head the cakes inside fell on the floor anl
were distributed among the guests. Bridal
favors are of Danish origin, the true ov
er's knot having been flrst designed by
Danish hearts and deriving its designation
from the Danish truelofaâ "l plight my
troth."
The Story of Senator Goebel and the Great Kentueky political Feud

Ing of Senator William Gbebe] from the window of the ex
ecutive building as he was on hla way to the Senate cham
ber was done not by a political opponent of Goebel but
by one of his own party. In other words, the opinion that

That was all; he never argued the quea-
tion: he did not ask why. It was such a
surprising answer that James was com-
pletely nonplused, and he retired from
the stage without another word. Goebel
was nominated without much further
trouble
During his campaign . there was much
bitterness and acrimony. Prominent Dem-
ocrats all over the State came out against
Goebel's candidacy.- Among them were
Senator Lindsay. General Simon B. Buck-
ner. Representative Owens and ex-Repre-
sentative Breckinrldge.
Senator Goebel defied* his enemies, and
by his abusive speeches outraged the pro-
prietie3. "Drunkard," "liar." "scoun-
drel." "cur," were some of the epithets
which he hurled at the most active of his
opponents.
During the storm of contumely Goebel's
life was often threatened, and he prom-
ised his enemies that when the campaign
was over he would wipe out some of the
insults to which he had l:een subjected.
It had #bÂ°en predicted that blood would
be shed on election day, but the polling
passed off without unusual incident. On
the same evening it became evident that
Goebel had been repudiated by the voters
of the State, xbut the former Senator re-
maiufd calm and confident. He claimed
his election. r>nd the returns were Juggled
in every precinct of the State to count
him in. But In spite of tliirf the plot failed,
Goebers agents had not provided against
the emergency of a great majority for
Taylor. Liberal as their dishonest calcu-
latlons were, the final totals showed a
Etr.all but sufficient margin for the Repub-
lican Attorney General.
It was here that one of the men on
whom Goebel had positively counted
tailed him and the result was the issue
of the certificate of election to Taylor,
The State Board of Election Commission-
ers met at Frankfort on December 4 to
canvass tlio returns. "Supplementary"
returr.s had poured in from various coun-
;ics throughout the State, changing ma-
Joritics in favor of Goebel. The latter's
faction began the circulation of reports
that an army of intimtdators was beinÂ«r
massed by the Republicans. Knowing
Democratic tactics the men from the
mountains did enter Frankfort. Prayer-
meetings were he.d in the churches, plead-
ing that bloodshed might not result,
Democratic claims were raised that In
these mountain districtsâthe counties of
jvnow, m3kduÂ»i, â¢-^mr , . â¢ â
sue" ballots had been used, am! that,
therefore, the votes cast here must be
thrown out. In the city of Loul3\l.le the
calling out.of the militia was construed
by them aa ground for the invalidating
of the election there,
After four d^ys of canvassing and the
hearing of argument Commissionersi Pry or
and Ellis decided that the board Â»a<
merely as a canvassing body and coui-i
not go behind the returns to aec.do
whether or not the contested
should be thrown out in the count thus
overcoming Taylor's admitted majority o.
2383 votes.
Governor William S. Taylor and Liea
tenant Governor John Marshall were ln
augurated on December 12. nothing un
usbal marking the Inauguration. On that
day th* minor nfTicers on the Republican
list were served with notic,s that contests
would be entered brf>>re the State Board
of Election Commissioners. The mountain
men left Franklin and quiet settled down.
The Goehel men made 7eady to take up
the contest against Taylor and Marshall
in the Genera! Assembly, where they held
a majority on Joint ballot of thirty-two,
O:-. January * ootb houses organized at
r.oon. On January 3 the formal notices
of various contests were read in both
houses. Committees to take charge of
these matters weie authorized on the fr>l
lowing day. the opposing factions drawing
names from a hat. Luck favored the
Gcebel side and they secured ten out of
the eleven members of the commute* au
thorized to nandle the contest over the
Governorship. The body to deal with the
Lieutenant Governorship organized with
nine of the eleven members Goebeiltes.
On January 2 the flrst test on Joint ballot
came, when a contesting member, a
Goebel sympathizer, was given his seat
in the Assembly by a vote of 61 to *5.
Since that thne the Republican leaders
t have caucused frequently, each time an
riouncirg that they wHI use tho troopt
and fight for thtir rights if necessa.-y.
This was ttte state of affairs when Goe
bel was shot. Every one is familiar with
the subsequent detailsâhow he was de
cjared elected by the Legislature on
Wednesday and received the oath of offlce
on his deathbed.
Whatever may be sad of Goebel. even
his enemies must admit that he was a re
markable man and by far the most capa
ble leader that the State of Kentucky
has had In any political party for years.

us to the' outskirts of the town, which
leads toward Mogi. One of the boys
bribed him to take us by giving .aim a

"I had lost my hat and had traded my
knife for a Japanese straw sombrero. We
did not rest easily until Nagasaki was out
of sight.
â¢ "The boys of our party scattered in the
city: two of them struck out north and
the rest of us went west over the moun
tains to Mogi. The prisoners in the other
boats we did not pee again.
"The mountains were covered with
snow and we had no underclothes on
only those thin khaki suits. We had been
for over, a year in the tropical climate
and were nearly frozen' to death. """ "
"The' fellow, whose clothes were wet was

Otto R. Conine of Company B, Sixteenth

There wÂ«* a bitterness In his vcJce and
a prlfle in Ms manner that imprisonment

we had had money there we wouldn't be

Japs won't give you food- unless you give
them money. We Boon found that out.
"A door between the compartments of

The McDowell touched day-street

The brown uniforms of the prisoners,

to charm the curious, and a crowd fol

was singing.
"She told me that In manhood

The men had been halted at the ttxrn

business of her music:
"She also said the world was full

A man at my elbow said brutally, "Are
you fellows prisoners?" No one answered
him.
McÃennett could stand no more. Great
tears rolled down his cheeks and his lips
twitched.
"Tell that woman to stop slnjringr and
I'll give her a dollar." yelled a kind-heart,
ed man.
The mob still stared at the boys In
brown, and McÃennett whispered as he
passed through the ferry gate:

Golf is not a hard or violent exercise.
I often go around the course tsn
times without feeling it. The coursa
is a mile and a half, with nine holes.
A player uses six or seven sticks, the
different holes requiring different
sticks.
There are young ladies here who
go, around two and three times, which
speaks very well for the endurance
of California girls.
My experience has taught me that
it requires two years for a naturally
adept player to put up a first-class
game of golf. T,hey can play fair 1
games in less time, but it takes that<
long to play golf with any style. One,
reason is that it often takes an in
structor almost as long to hit upon'
the faults of the pupil as it docs to(
correct those faults. He knows th?re (

THE STTNDAY- CALL.
What the Leading Literary Lights of the World Are Doing
By Professor H.B. Lathrop
of Stanford University.
rr E ROY HOOKER'S "The African
ders" endeavors to give a dlspaa
jl f eionate history of the relations be-
J tween The Dutch and the English
In South Africa. Mr. Hooker makes no
attempt to conceal the fact that on the
whole his sympathy is with the Dutch,
ret he carrfully keeps distinct his narra
tive of the facts and the inferences which
he draws from the facts. He provides the
reader with the materials for forming an
Independent judgment on the merits of
each controversy in the long-drawn strug
gle between two civilizations, and in this
way he makes it possible to criticize or
oppose his own opinions. Mr. Hooker
Ehows admirable skill and self-control In
presenting an uncolorc-d history of the con
test between the Dutch and the English.
Yet it could ho -wished that at the very
er.d of his tale, in the narrative of the
conspiracies on each Fide to overthrow
tJio rule of the other Bide in South Africa,
the ascertained facts had been objectively
presented without Interruption by com
ment or argument. The chapter in which
the causes of the present war are most
completely analyzed begins with the af
firmation that if Cecil Rhodes and his
projects had been eliminated from the sit
uation after the Jameson raid there would
have been no war. The plan followed In
the rest of the book would have given the
reader a full opportunity to understand
the reasons which led Mr. Hooker to this
conclusion; but at this point he leaves
fcls general assertions without specific evi
dence. They color the feelings with
tvhich the statement of facts In the rest
cf the chapter is given, and lead the
reader to interpret those facts in a man
ner adverse to the British claims. Still,
even hero the actual diplomatic corre
spondence- Is presented in such a manner
that a reader can easily determine
whether It seems to justify Mr. Hooker's
Inferences as to the ulterior ends of both
Boers and English. Leaving Cecil Rhode*
out of the question, the treatment of tho
Increasing- English pressure and of Boer
tcmr>orizinK is very lucid.
to the necessity for broad knowledge and q i
Intellectual force which Defoe asserts In
favor of the wholesale tradesman. It Is oi
Btill more Interesting to observe that Mr. a

on courage, the moral courage of a gen- ti
eral If possible, if not. the physical cour- â¢*Â¦
ape of the private soldier, as a prime re- ti

Mr. Wood's book appears now in a sec- '
Â»nd edition. It is to be hoped If It reaches '
i third edition Mr. Wood will amplify It
vith a much greater number, of lllustra
ive anecdotes, or brief narratives, which
villgive pungency to his general sugges
ions and make their bearing clearer. It
s also desirable that he should Bay some
hing about the gambling Instinct which
s bo frightful a tax on individual and
society alike, and which seems to be a

There are fa liions in other things
than In manners and garments. Science,
in spite of the too often antiquated or
bizarre appearance of its representatives,
has its constantly changing modes. "One
might as well be dead as out of the fash
ton," Is true of more than men and
women: it Is true of books and methods.
Not so many years ago botany was re
garded as a study especially adapted to
the co-called finishing schools for girls,
an Indispensable part of the curriculum
in every young ladles' seminary, a subject
quite too effeminate for boys and young
men. There was some reason for this be
lief, for In this country botany was little
studied. Affected though a certain, sort of
botany certainly v. v..i by sentimental spin
sters and leisured clergymen. The text
books of botany by the eminent Asa Gray,
the friend of Darwin and the first great
botanist America produced, did much to
raise botany in this country from a di
version and an accomplishment to a seri
ous study. , If anything his books went
too far, for they were so largely made up
of definitions of technical words and led
so certainly to the amassing of names
that people presently became bored or
burdened by the mere vocabulary" of the
science. From, this aspect of botanical
science Its own devotees turned. From
an examination of the external character
of plants large enough to be seen with the
naked eye there was a rush to the study
of Internal characters, of the structure,
of large plants and an examination of
microscopic forms. , In this new world of
microscopic botany some see all that there
is of the science; a plant is of little or no
interest until it Is cleft In pieces, and un
til these pieces are_examined under the
microscope. From " such examination
gradually emerges a conception of the
probable or possible relationships of the
plant, and It is fitted into a niche in the
scheme of classification.
tory. It Is not sufficiently living. It is not
the study of living things where they
grow. There must needs be then a return
to the out-door world, but now the botan
ist goes around with a camera quite v
much as with a collecting tin or with dry
ing papers neatly concealed in a portfolio.
He sees plants in groups, photographs a
group, calls It a "plant society," as la
Coulter's Interesting book called "Plant
Relations," and gives the group some such
name as "Hydrophyte Society." a name
which is neither attractive nor really sci
entific. Any farmer knows that plants of
different sorts grow in groups, because they
have common meeds and are adapted to
the same conditions. So plants which grow
in wet places grow together there, not be
cause they exert any mutual attraction
upon each other but because they all need
much water.. So .Coulter"* flydrophyte

One of the elements of the book which
will be of special Interest and value to the
Beneral reader Is the explanation of the
deep-lying causes which have worked for
three centuries to form the Boer charac
ter. â¢ The most important among these
causes are represented as being conserva
tive, not to say fanatical, religious epln
lons, the practice of Flavery and an iso
lated and nomadic way of living. The
Boer Is, by force of circumstances, intol
erant because devout and < ignorant; ty
rannical and unenterprising because ig
norant and a slaveholder, and in a meae
ure uncivilized because Ignorant, alone
and wandering. He is at the same time
fiercely Independent. Uon-Hke in bravery
and capable of sublime devotion to a
cause which enlists his enthusiasm.
Such a temper makes strong though im
perfect men, but a weak state. Except
under the consolidating pressure of exte-r
ral danger the Boers of the African veldt
have never showrr the capacity to main
tain a coherent political organization.
Left to themselves, they have been en
graved In factious, internal dissension or
have disintegrated into petty communi
ties. The excitement of brief wars with'
the natives has brought them together in
Finaller or larger bands, to disperse and
wrangle at the return of peace; but the
soberer and more difficult unity of per
manent civil order has never been ef
fectively maintained by them for
rhort periods in theface of Imminent dan
ger.
The description of the Transvaal Dutch
by Mr. Hooker reads like a descrtptlon of
milder and more virtuous Scythians, the
barbarous -wanderers over the steppes of
Europe described at the beginning of his
tory by. Greek observers. Before the
coming In of the Ultlanders, they lived
In the comparatively idle enjoyment of
slave-holding pastoral nomads. Their
business was transacted by barter. They
had not the civilization to value aright
Â¦well -ordered public institutions. Their
treasury was "in a state of chronic emptl
m-ES," their paper currency fell to 25 per
cent of its facÂ«Â» valu<\ "Public works and
proper internal administration were un
known. Largely, every man's will was his
law. which he was disposed to enforce
upon others â whether black or whiter â by
the strong hand." The language of the
people was a dc-generate dialect. In brief,
the Boers were in a condition between
barbarism and civilization, in a condition
the instability of which was to be shown
by the first attack from without.
The attack came in the form of a war
with the Kaffirs, which threatened the
destruction of the Dutch. In sheer self
defence, the British protected the hand
ful of liners, defeated the attacking sav
ages and very sensibly annexed the
Transvaal. The British Government cer
tainly showed a lack of wisdom, if not
of honesty. In its dealings with the
Dutch of the Trar.sv.ial when they were
under British sovereignty; but the one un
forgivable blunder of British statesman
chip was the giving up of its reasonable
and Just control of a people who had
never been able to control or defend
themselves. The same blunder was re
rraud after Majuba Hill, when the Brit
ish granted concessions after defeat. The
unpractical idealism of Mr. Gladstone has
cost mam* a noble life, and will leave a
heritage of hate and bitterness to genera
[tinns of Dutch and English who might
have united in a . peaceful development
cf a common country.
On the whole, the narrative of Mr.
Hooker seems to show with great plain
ness that, as between the Dutch and Eng
lish control of the Transvaal, all consid
erations of reason pointed to the ultimate
English supremacy as not only right, but
Inevitable. The growth of an English
ppeaking population, the spread of busi
ness in English hands and. above all, the
superiority of English civilization, would
In course "of time have swept the Trans
vaal Irresistibly into the British Empire.
At the same time Mr. Hooker's narra
tive would appear to show conclusively
the criminal folly of which Mr. Rhodes,
filr Arthur Milner and Mr. Chamberlain
have been guilty in endeavoring to
quicken the slow pace of time and nature.
There is not one. act of the Transvaal
Government among those complained of
by the British In the correspondence
which preceded the war now going onâ
not otjpâ which was not absolutely nat
ural under the provocation of the Jame
eon raid and the foolish vaporing of Eng
lishmen. The British by both aggression
and concession have strengthened the
Dutch tense of nationality. They have
created the strength which defies them.
The feeling which Mr. Hooker's work
leaves in the mind is one of passionate
regret and indignation that injudicious
haste and ambition should have been able
to defeat the good work of time. The
book contains many good portraits and
two maps on a large scale. It will be of
creat Interest to those who wish to have
a clear view of affairs in South Africa,
but who cannot afford the time and
money necessary to go to the ultimate
authorities. Mr. Hooker's style Is admir
ably clear and dignified.
(Rand, McNally & Co., Chicago.)
It Is seldom that a successful man of
business analyzes for the world something
of the secret of his own art. There are
only two books in English with which I
em acquainted that deal with the ques
tions of practical busineÃS life in a way
at once broad and practical, and that
have any literary merit. These are De
foe's "Complete British Tradesman" and
Sir Arthur Helps' "Thoughts in the In

The standard effects in this kind or
writing are attained with satisfactory In

which this novel is developed. The hero

the vision is the daughter of the d-adâ
her' mother's very self outwardly and in

the author; but the elaborate complica

the story to work to the clearly flpflned

such an end Is undignified and art

J[ mish, Wash. This beautiful, study was made by George
James Fowzer, the youngest art photographer on the coast,
and has been pronounced by the artists of this city to be one of the
finest bhotoerabhs ever taken on the subject. Several Eastern maga-
zincs have repeatedly sent to the young photographer asking per
mission to reproduce this picture. Mr. Fowzer is visiting San

MARCIA JAN
DRESSER
THE BUSTUNIANS
BEAUTY
SHE is exactly like her picture*.
This is saying something for her
photographers, but more for Miss
Van Dresser. . It takes a wonder
to live up to her photographs.
Miss Van Dresser is announced as the
new ' beauty of the Eostonlans. Every
body sees that she is a beauty, but every
body doesn't see why. She is irresistibly
iir'^rfectâ faultlessly faulty.
Take the forehead, for instance. There
is too much of it, as ideals go. Ideals do
not, always allow space for brain, but
Miss Van Dresser's forehead does.
The eyebrows are clearly marked and
they keep far enough apart to insure good
cheer. But if ah artist were to paint
them he would take the artist's license of
arching them more than nature has done.
Bccau.;e it Is the artist's right to idealize.
The nose and mouth able to stand"
on their own merits. The nose is not.
aquiline enough to be Roman, not straight
enough to be Grecian, but quite charm
ing enough to be American. The mouth
is Cupid's bow, and there's an end of it.
The ears, you see, are at fault. Know
ing Miss Van Dresser as an opera singer
one would look for better things from the
cars. She says she is. looking forward to
the drama as her life profession. Per
haps that accounts for the cars.
Her eyes are small and dark and they
look smaller and darker because of the
way they have of laughing. They are
tucked away in the creases of a laugh
no much of the time that they seem nigh
to disappearing. But a laugh is such a
good, wholesome thing for them to be lost
In.
The hair just, escapes being: black. It
lies in big silky folds, framing a face that
is pale and yet of perfect health.
'. The hands are large, handsome, mascu
line. The thumb tilts backward "a bit.
That is how it comes that Miss Van
Dresser intends to take to "heavy work"
whether or not people say "stick to-light
opera." She wears one mannish seal ring.
You may study the sections of her beau
ty upon this page. It will not be imper
tinent, but useless. For when you are
through you will not be able to say why
she is called our. latest and greatest
beauty. You have, found faults if not
fault. But both in person and in photo
graph you catch -the charm. It is In the
bigness, the breeziness, the beautiful
saneness of her. It is in the heartiness
and the self poise.How San Francisco Notables Look in Theatrical Roles

11THE SUNDAY CAI/L.
â¢Hr-JETE sculptor has one advantage over
| his brother in art, the painter, for
Ji his work can be placed where he who
runs may see it, or shut his eyea,
while the painter must hide his work
away where it meets the eyes of those
only who care to seek It.
Of course, this does not mean that finer
work of the sculptor, specimens of which
are In our Park Museum, but the morÂ«
enduring If less beautiful work which Is
found scattered about the park from tha
epot not far from the entrance where
stands the bronze figure of Halleck to tho
hill far out on the north drive where the
huge Prayer-book Cross rises against tha
Â»ky.
There may be some among these which
can hardly be called artistic, but others
have been praised by men who are fa
miliar with the famous statues of the
world. One of these renowned Judges
spoke words of highest praise of the
beautiful figure which stands directly In
front of the museum, tiie "cider preas"
drinking fountain; an 3 no more lovely
object of its kind can be found than the
big bronzs vase with its decorations of
Fauns, Cupids and elves draped with
vines and hiding behind leaves which
faces It on the pavement before the door
of the museum.
Another figure which repays the visitor
is the one which marks the spot where
was turned the first sod to prepare thÂ«
ground for the fair.
Modern dressâ particularly the dress of
the modern manâ does not lend itself
gracefully to the sculptor's art. There
fore the standing figures of the GarfleM
monument, of that erected to Thomas
Starr King and the oHe to General Hal
leck can hardiy be called objects of art,
though in ths case of General Halleck
the sculptor got over his difficulty In a
measure by draping a wide cloak toga
fashion around the figure, hiding the most
awkward lines of tho costume.
But nothing was hidden, nothing dis
guised in the bronze figure of martyred
Garfleld, and but for the adjuncts this
monument would be unparfionably ugly.
The pose, the dress and the situation are
all as bad as possible, but tho building up
of the pedestal on its several differing
levels takes the eye from the defects of
the crowning figure, and the mourning
figure seated on the top of the pedestal,
half way between the ground and the
Btatue, Intended to be the principal object.
Is more often spoken of than is that,
crowning the monument.
The Starr King monument stands lower,
therefore the figure appears better than
does that of Garfield, although this also
is marred by Its dress.
The Key memorial at the head of the
ievel stretch before the present music
stand ranks between these and the finer
onss. It is more ornate in design and the
figure being seated and in older dros.-i
makes it a more picturesque object than
tho>Â«e before mentioned.
While the dress of Douglas Tllden's
"Ball Player" Is most emphatically mod
Â¦ em. tha life and action of the figure are
enough to hide all deficiencies of that
Iklnd.
This Is the only statue In the park
Jbich is lifelike enough to deceive on* In
photograph. IX one who had novctr
seen tho statue was shown a photograph
of the figure without ito pedestal and told
that it was taken from a living model
on the ball ground he would never dream
of doubting the truth of the statement.
The bust of Grant near the museum
draws attention and deserves It. Being
a bust the dress does not detract from its'
appearance, and the objects placed at the
foot are gracefully arranged and appro
priate.
Away to the right of the north drive.
Just opposite the boathouso near the
lake, stands the huge granite cross given
by George W. Childs to commemorate the
first service of the English church held
on this coastâ at Drakes Bay, about June
24, 1573. The cross stands high above tho
drive, on a hillock which is being cut
away, and thÂ« path leading to the hillock
top is rough and evidently not often trod
den. The cross itself is a grand object,
seen against the Fky from all sides, and
It eeems a pity that the ground should
be cut from under it Perhaps it la not
Intended to cut much nearer than has al
ready been done.
These are all the statues to be found In
the open park, and those within the
museum's walls of course are far more
valuable either as studies in art or in
money value, but there are hundreds who
see those scattered about the grounds
to one who visits the museum.
There are many spots about the park
where other statues could be placed to
advantage, and there have been several
different schemes proposed for placing
statues of half a dozen different noted
men. It takes a good while to talk the
public up to the point, as is proved by
the length of time between the death
of Grant and the placing of his bust on its
pedestal, but probably within the noxt
two years two or more other statues will
be placed in the park. There Is room for
many others, as well as for several other
improvements which will probably have
to bo done by either gift, bequest or
popular subscription since the regular im
provements and enlargement of the park
proper take all the appropriation for the
keeping up of the place.
There have been several gifts which
have added much, to the beauty -ol tha
city's playsrround.
The greatest of these girts Is the $90,000
given this year by public-spirited Claus
Spreckels, and which la now b<ng used
to erect a music stand, which, when fin
ished, will be second to none In tho coun
try. Next In amount stands the $50,000
bequeathed by Senator Sharon, In ISSB, for
the buildlns of the lodge at the children's
playground. The building is one worthy
of Its situation, and is a, grand monu
ment to the generosity of the donor.
C. P. Huntlngton gave $25,000 In 1532,
â¢which was used to make the very natural
appearing falls which gleam out white
against the green of Strawberry Hill
(when the water is allowed to flow over
the rocks), and which bear tho name- of
the man whose gift enabled tho Commis
sioners to add this feature of beauty to
the hillside.
It la popularly supposed that the laks
on the side of Strawberry Hill was a gift
from W. W. Stow, but this is a mistake.
The work was done and paid for by tha
Park Commissioners from the regular ap
propriation.
The observatory crowning: the- hill was
built In IS9I by the generosity of Thomas
Sweeney at a cost of $15,000.
These are all the gifts to the park so
far, but it Is hoped that the example set
may be followed by other wealthy pub
lic-spirited citizens. When the p&nhandl*
is extended to Market street there will be
many choice sites which should be
adorned by some beautiful statue, either
a memorial of some noted man or a mere
object of beauty, and surely there are
men In the city who will come forward
and donate sums sufficient to add these
touches of beauty to the work planned
already by tho authorities.
There should be also several arched en
trances to the park. Several times It haÂ«
been reported that this or that one was
about to donate money for the purpose of
erecting such an entrance, but it has
not yet materialized.
The grand lodge at the entrance, the mu
seum, the beautiful boathouse on the hill,
the children's lodgeâ these are all last-
Ing monuments. There should be others.
There la room enough In the park to us*
all the funds which may be donated. Who
will he neit on the roll of given to thÂ»

ENTRY OF ROBERTS
INTO JACOBSDAL
JACOBSDAL. Thursday, Feb. 15.â Lord
Roberts' troops to-day entered this town,
which has been in the possession of the
British Eince yesterday. The utmost or
der prevails. Military police the streets,
but not a stick of furniture â not even an
apple from the treesâ has been taken. A
eentry has been placed before each store
and the soldiers are allowed to enter and
purchase what they require. Everything
Is bo peaceful that the Inhabitants ex
press the utmost surprise, as It had been
diligently reported that the British occu
pation meant instant looting. Judging
from the conversation of the inhabitants
the Free Staters are very weary of the
war. It Is openly stated that President
Bteyn betrayed the people. When the lat

In the stories of the looting proclivities
of the British the townspeople welcomed
the troops as friends. Since the battle of
Modder River the town has not been gar

hospital depot. When the Boers fired on
the British Wednesday the townspeople
protested. Although the British shelling
yestVday considerably frightened the

ROBERTS FAILED TO
CUT OFF CRONJE'S FORCE
LONDON, Feb. 17.â Spencer Wilkinson,
the military expert, reviewing the situa
tion in South Africa for the Associated
Press at midnight, says:,
"Lord Roberts has bepun his campaign
by striking at the principal Boer forces
in the western theater. of warâ that of
Commandant Cronje, covering the siege of
Kimberley.
'.'ln a -111116 over a week Lord Roberts

LONDON, Feb. 18.â Events
in the Orange Free State
fairly tread upon each
other's heels. More dispatches
have come from Roberts, one
giving exciting particulars of
events following the relief of
Kimberley. The morning pa
pers, while expressing greater
delight over what they termed
the turn in the tide for British
arms since Roberts and Kitch
ener had taken things in hand,
had some fear that Commandant
Cronje had something in reserve,
for they reasoned that while
mention was made of the capture
of stores, etc., nothing was said
about any guns. The inference
was that Cronje had taken alarm
and gone in a hurry to some hew
position, where he might- offer
battle. But such is apparently
not the case as Cronje and his
force have been found. The Boer
leader, according to the latest ac
counts, was at bay and in a very
tight place.
It will be remembered that
yesterday Lord Roberts reported
that a large Boer convoy which
had fled toward Bloemfontein,
the Free State capital, was being
pursued by one of Kelly-Kenny's
brigades. It would seem that to
save themselves the Boers aban
doned all their impediments in
their flight, for Lord Roberts
says that Kelly-Kenny made a
great haul, capturing seventy
eight wagons laden with stores,
eight boxes full of shells and ten
barrels full of explosives, all be
longing to Cronje's laager.
With regard to Cronje himself
it seems that he was forced to
has captured a Boer convoy the
Boers, on the other hand, have
captured a large British convoy,
all through a mistake or rather
through an order from Roberts
going astray in some unex
plained way. .It was during
Thursday^ fighting on Riet
River that this happened. Noth
ing is said about how large an
amount of stores and ammuni
tion was captured, but as the
convoy was a large one the loss
would seem to be considerable.
Roberts had sent instructions to
the convoy not to proceed, but
the order never reached its des
tination. Then reinforcements
were dispatched, but the Boers
succeeded in capturing the con
voy before these could arrive.
In the central field of war Gen
eral Gatacre is also active and ex
changing shots with the enemy.
Nothing, very important has
come to hand from him yet.
General Buller also seems de
termined to make another at
tempt to relieve Ladysmith. Late
at night news was received that
he was again attacking the
Boers. While no details of the
fighting have arrived it looks
very much as if he was trying
Fort Wylie and Inhlawe Moun
tain, by capturing which he
might be able to move along the
right bank of the river nearly as
far as Pieters and thence work
his way to Ladysmith by a route
which, speaking topographically,
is comparatively easy. But we
must wait for something more
definite before being, sure of what
he is doing. That will not'eome
until after the attempt has proved
successful or failed.
Showing How the British Are Trying to Head Off Boers Under Cronje.
PRETORIA, Friday, Feb. 16.â 1t appears from further reports of yester
day' 6 fighting at Jacobsdal that 2000 British troops got through the federal
position at Modder River and entered Kimberley. The federals intercepted the
rear guard of , the British and captured great booty, many oxen and a number
of prisoners.

had a 'semi-circle around the Boer 'posi

south, and possibly the line was prolonged
from Modder .River station to the north
west, so that General French might, hope,'
by. passing through Klmberley, complete
the entire < circle and. to enable Lord Rob
erts to "envelop . and capture 'Â¦ Cronje"s

"This" was . the result i hoped ; for.- - ?The
plan was brilliantly "conceived and 'vigor

to evade the blow.* "When General French

Cronje, - with ' the â¢ bulk â¢of - his force, had

VOf â¢ the ; First and * Ninth . divisions , no

and the Inference is that a part of the de
sign is as yet undisclosed. Possibly their
function is to complete the circle in the
west. Perhaps, too, a force is making to
the eastward, south of the Modder River,
to intercept Cronje. though, as the mount

"There can be no doubt that Klmberley

The people are all so accustomed now to the shelling (writes the Mafeking officer who sends the sketch from

Sometimes "a blind" and spent shell comes along and there Is great competition to capture it,. One fell the other

valued at $6&,<<f>o. The ranch is "one of tho
most highly improved in the county and
"has recently 1 been deeded by PMnsteln to
his wife. Delphine Einstein, and Algel
tlngor alleges that the de<*d was' made for
the purpose and intent Â¦to - defraud.
Prayer is also made that It be' adjudged
that the plaintiff-has a good and substan
tial Hen on the property.
According to the -complaint, plaintiff ad
vanced and loaned money to Mr. Einstein
during the year of 1839. On January 30
of this year Mr. Algeltinger brought suit
in the Superior Court for the recovery of
the money loaned, together with interest,
and a writ of attachment was issued,
directed to the Sheriff of San Diego Coun
ty,, requiring him to attach- and keep the
property belonging to Mr, Einstein situ
ated In this county. The Sheriff did as he
was requested, but found the property in
the Â¦ name of Delphine Einstein. Mr.
Angel tinger claims that at the time of
the creation of the indebtedness by Mr.
-Einstein, the latter was owner In fee
of the property, and that on or about
March 29.- 1899,. he entered with the In

Into a fraudulent and collusive agreement
to mike a pretended sale and' assignment
of the Red Mountain ranch to his wife,
Delphine Einstein.
The allegation Is made that the defend
ant tlatmed to be the owner of the ranch
and that it was clear of all lncumbrances,
and that If anything should happen to thn
business of Jacob Einstein & Co.. so that
the firm could not meet Its obligations,
the ranch was of sufficient value to meet
and pay all claims against him. J .* , .â¢

His Wrist Mangled.
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call. S--7Â»'.-4
MERCED. Feb. 17.â John Smith, the 16
year-old son of J. C. Smith of this city,
met with a serious accident, which will
probably result in the loss of his left
hand. Early this morning . Smith, a
schoolmate and a man who was the
driver for them started for a hunt, and It
was when they were returning home that a
shotgun accidentally went off, wounding
Smith. Young Smith was on the seat with
the driver and was holding the shotgun
between his knees with the barrel up. The
stock must have struck against the bed of
the wagon, thus causing the- gun. to dis
charge. The charge entered . his left
wrist, tearing the flesh and shattering the
bones. The wounded .boy was Immediately
driven to town and taken to a physician's
office, where an examination was made of
the wound. Tbe attending physicians be
lieve that amputation is necessary. The
father .has decided to remove the unfor
tunate boy t6 San" Francisco, where he
will receive the attention of the most
skilled physicians, with" the hope of saving
the hand. . . .

KRUGER'S CONFIDENCE.
NEW TORK, Feb. 17.â A dispatch which
Judgment and energy of the Boer leaders.
The vigorous attack on the British post at
Renaberg shows that the Boers mean to
reply to Lord Roberts' advance by strik
ing at his communications.
"Until the issue of the operations around
Kimberley is fully known It is useless to
speculate upon the next move of Lord
Roberts. The fact that Kimberley has
been relieved and that Cronje had to
make a hasty retreat are to the good side
of the account, but the fact that Cronje
has not, at any rate up to the date of the
latest telegrams I have seen, been well
beaten in a fight, is a disappointment.
The opinion is widespread that the in
vasion of the Free State will bring the
Boer army, or at Jeast the Free State
contingent, out of Natal. Upon this
point I am less sanguine than most of the
English observers, even thWse- whose Judg
ment nioet deserves confidence, but the
news of Roberts' advance -will encourage
White's men to prolong their defense."
SEEKING CONFIRMATION
OF MACRUM'S CHARGES
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.-Secretary Hay
sent instructions to Consul Hay at Preto
ria to-day directing him to Investigate and
report as soon as possible the allegations
of former Consul Charles T. Macrum that
the British censor at Durban opened -his
official mall. It is said at the State De
partment that the official records of the
consulate should show whether the mall
of the Consul had been opened. As has
been stated, Mr. Macrum's reports contain
no reference to such an occurrence, and
If the consular files are likewise silent
the officials Bay the only conclusion that
can be arrived at is that Mr. Macrum' si
charge is without foundation, or he has
taken from the .flies envelopes opened by
the censor and marked, as he alleges. Re
specting the latter contingency, tho of
ficials declare a Consul has no right to re
move anything of an offlcia.l oharacter be
longing to the Government files. Certain
ly the envelopes have not reached the
State Department. .
Should Consul Hay report that the en
velopes were opened, as alleged; by Mr.
Macrum, the department will act to pre
vent a repetition of the occurrence. It Is
considered remarkable by the officials that
the mail of an American. Consul who i 3
representing British interests should have
been opened when mail, of other Consuls,
whose governments are'notoriously-sym
pathetically inclined toward the Boers, Is
allowed to' pass unopened. The fact that
Mr. Macrum's sympathies are with the
Boers is no surprise to "the" officials, for
his reports have shown' the trend of his
sympathy. It is not- an uncommon tact.
a department official said to-day, for Con
suls in countries at war to writo reports
strongly sympathizing with the govern
ments to which they are accredited, and
It Is left to the authorities here to deter
mine the course to pursue, usually, as in
the case of the British-Boer war-, that of
strict neutrality.
WHAT THE SENTIMENT
OF AMERICANS MAY DO
LONDON. Feb. 17.â H. W. Alasslngham,
formerly the editor of the Chronicle,
writes as follows to the Morning Leader,
under the heading. "What. Will America
Do?":
A new world power has arlsen^-the great
American people.
President McKlnley and Secretary of State
Hay share. I believe, the opinion of the minor
ity of Englishmen that the war in South Africa
is an error and a crime. But they remember
that, thanks to the pressure from below,
the English Government was benevolently
neutral In the Spanish war. Therefore,
as ' far as' public opinion will allow
them they would like to sail on an even keel
in South Africa. But. as they well know, be
hind them lies" a mighty and, as they well
know, an ungovernable force, expressing itself
with absolute freedom, forcing its will on party
managers, knocking Imperatively at the doors
of tte President.
Because a few American ladles who had mar
ried or fought their way into English society
started a hospital ship it. was imagined that
American sympathies were with British power.
Nothing can be more unfortunate than any po
litical . action.' that comes from . such Quarters
and la blessed by such negligible : persons as

LONDON. Feb. 17.-A week that opened

lantly told- and retold until s^^ary
mattera of Interest such as Parliamentary
proceedings obtain but passing notice, or
these the most ratable was Lord Rose
bery's vivid analysis of Great Britain s
isolation. . _â¢ '.:*â¢-". ? Â»,_._-
The new. military programme * hl Â«*
bom this week haa droned along to* a Â£*
enactment, being accepted more In tne
light of a makeshift than anything else,
and Is quite overshadowed by the former
Premier's remarks, though his pessimistic
views were discounted by the almost sim
ultaneous publication of Lord Roberta
SU The S manner in which Lord Rosebery de
livered-this remarkable oration was tun
usually theatrical and in other respects
savored of an appeal to the gallery, giv
ing A. J. Balfour, the Government leader
in the House of Commons, the opportun
ity the following day to gibe the ex-pre
mier with unusual, bitterness upon his
"tones of trembling emotion, etc.
Yet- Lord 'Rosebery merely voiced what
is undoubtedly the predominant opinion
In Great Britain, but. though he may have
the'majority behind him in his pessimism.
It does not follow that Lord Kosebery s
deductions are correct. The generalising
with which Lord Salisbury answered ana
has answered since the war began, there
by so keenly irritating such influential
organs of his own party as- the London
Times, Standard. Morning Post and Tele
graph, are the studied utterances of an
experienced statesman, who is just as
much aware of their political -lnadvis
ability as any of his critics, for, through
his subordinates, he keeps in close touch
with popular feeMng. .rience, an under
lying motive must be looked for. and there
Is a growing impression that Lord Salis
bury Is sacrificing politics to what he
rightly or wrongly believes to be the
statesmanship of the last quarter of a
century. His strength, patriotism and
diplomacy have often been severely tested
and found not wanting, hence the idea
that his continued refusal to take the na
tion into his confidence at this crisis is
prompted by motives of the highest im
portance. __
The conduct of the Foreign Office,
where there is not the slightest Inclina
tion to underestimate the difficulties or
overestimate the national capabilities,
certainly bears out this solution of the
enigma that puzzles the Conservatives as
much as it provides capital for the Lib
erals.
A reasonable supposition waa sug-.
gested by a well-known Peer, who said:
"It is more than likely that Lord Salis
bury, though seeing no immediate likeli
hood of foreign complications, wishes to
prepare fcr the contingency and be able to
meet It with a free hand, unfettered by
any recent utterances confessing weak
ness or exposing strength."
In support of this it Is Interesting to
observe that at the moment Lord Rose
bery was demanding naval mobilization
the admiralty was engaged in instituting
the preliminaries for that ve,ry move by
ascertaining at all the naval ports the
number of ships that could be immediate
ly commissioned and issuing OTdera for
three, battleships and three cruisers,- all
of the reserve, to coa! at once In order
to be ready lor commissioning In case
they were required. ...
- Yet from Lord Salisbury's dilettante re
ply to Lord Rosebery no one would have
thought this last step was contemplated.'
The possibilities of having the Zulus as
allies has shocked the British. But fn.
whole the logic of their right of self-de
fense and the duty of Great Britain to
help them, even though' they are savages,
are taken as justincation for Joseph
Chamberlain's views. It is more . than
probable that native Indian troops will
eventually be used in South Africa. There
is a strong element in the Cabinet in fa
vor of this step and it la likely it would
have been taken long ago but for fear of
the non-conformist conscience and other
religio-political influences, for the an
nouncement of the intention to employ
Indian troops In the war, coming on the
top of the Zulu announcement, would
have been a bitter pill for many to swal
low.
It Is a strange anomaly to find Great
Britain, the home of the emigrant,
threatened by the immigrant, yet such
is the case. Industrial activity and the
Increase in wares in the United Kingdom
have attracted hordes of continental la
bor. Last month alone about 4000 Immi
grants arrived, a large increase on the
average. The Globe plaintively remarks:
"When the present wave of Industrial
prosperity is succeeded by a wave of ad
versity we shall have on our hands a mul
titude of foreigners, eagerly competing for
the bread which ought by right to nourish
the native born. We have no legislative*
machinery for sifting out pauper aliens
and returning them to their own coun
tries, as they have In the United States."
Winston Churchill's first novel. "Sav
rola," was published this week and has
been tolerably well reviewed. The young
war correspondent has depicted the polit
ical intrigue and revolution in the Imag
inary republic of Laurania, throwing in
lots of fighting, epigrams and political
maxims, the latter evidently gathered
from his experience In England. The

FAVORABLE REPORT ON
HEPBURN'S CANAL BILL
House Committee Points Out the Ben

WASHINGTON. Feb. 17.â Chairman
Hepburn of the. House Committee on In
terstate and Foreign Commerce to-day
submitted the report of the committee in
favor ot the Hepburn bill for constructing
i_he Nicaragua!! canal. The report fays
If the provisions of the bill can be carried
rut the United States -Hill, within a few years
? from six to eigho. be in- fuli -ownerehl|Â» Â«nJ
control of a waterway connecting the oceans.
that it can defend and that it can use in the
Interests of its navy and its merchant marine
as wl?dctn may dictate.
There eeems to be but little doubt that the
rtates of Nicaragua and Costa Kica will give
their consent for the construction of this great
work. It will traverse either the border or
the Interior of Nicaragua fur a distance of
kbout l? 0 miles. It will give to that state a
waterway from its capital and itÂ» most pro
tfuctlve region to the ?*a. It will place that
country on one of the great waterways of the
world, bringing it into Immediate contact with
k large foreign commerce, and those who con
duct it. In very many ways the state will
J-.ave advantages not now possessed, and that
will be for a long time lost If another mute
by which the oceans are connected should be
adopted. All of these considerations induce
the belief that these two enlichtwd state? will
he glad to aid our Government cordial ly anil
efficiently la carrying out this grÂ»-at design.
After reviewing the several surveys the
report continues:
These reports above referred to. the opln'.cns
ef the engineers and scientist! believed to m
entirely competent fÂ»r their work. Justify your
committee in recommending the undertaking
of the enterprise us cr.e entirely practicable
Â«_â¢ d one that can be coir-.pleted for a sum or
money, the expenditure of which will be wise.
It Is true that the fhtimate* of cost are vari
able ranging as they do from less than $40,
<WO 000 to a possible Jn:.,ovo.o(K>. It Is. however,
proper to say that the size and character o.
ihe canal estimated for is as variable as is
the coet. The earliest estimates were tor a
canal suited to the ship* of the time. The
later estimate* are for ehlpa of this time. * ir
teea feet depth and fifty feet width was the
hire of the earlier project. Thirty feet depth
acd ISO feet width are the dimensions o. the
later proposed cacal.
Income of the Canal.
Dealing- with the varying estimates as
to the probable Income- of the canal the
report sa.ys>:
One gesileman has ea'.d that, in his Judg
ment, not more than 300.000 tens would pass
through the canal annually. Another has eaid
that U 01/*0 1 /* 00y tons would I'uss through the
canal. Oemlerr.en connected with tbe Maritime
Canal Com.ps.ny gave it jus their opinion that
t <X>o 000 or 6.W0.U0U of tonnage wrould be the
amount that would pass through the canal an
nually. Of course we have the right to ss
â¢ume that, whatever the amount bÂ«. It would
be an increasing amount from year to year.
U present $1 oi per ton is the toll charged for
the use of tbe Suez Canal. If that rate were
the rate charped at the Nicaragua Canal, and
4 OOC 000 be the tonnage passage through it, an
Â¦Lggrvgate sum of more than 16.000.600 would be
tbe receipts. It is estimated that the cost of
Tr.h:r:\:.-:.-zjg and operating the canal would be
JLOOO.OOO annually. If the United States bor
rowed the money to Invest In the enterprise
this sum would pay the annual Interest, the
cost of maintalnlr.g and operating and leave a
surplus of mon than $1,000,000. And with the
Increasing tonnage we might reasonably hope
for euch accumulations of surplus that would
In a few rears fully reimburse the Government
Tor its outlay. Or if it should be the policy to
Â¦use the canal to st)n-.o!ate the building up of
the taerchÃTit marine It could be made a most
powerful factor. A British vessel trading from
any port in Great Britain to Hongkong, char
tering a 6000-ton vessel and ueir.g the Sue*
Canal, must pay as toils a kuhi la excess of
918.000 for tbe round voyage.
His American rival, trading from New Tork
to Hongkong, using the Nicaragua Canal free
cf toll because he used a veÂ«sel made in an
American shipyard out of American material
and by Americas labor, and loaded with Amer
ican merchandise, would po6s*Â»ts marked ad
var.tag* â advantag** so marked aa to make
It his interest to stimulate American shipbuild
ing- .
It la thto kind of a canal, that may be
used In this way, discriminating in favor of
far merchants and shipbuilders and our labor,
if euch shcuM be the policy of the Government,
that i Â¦-. ur committee are anxious to secure.
Ho Partnerships Wanted.
Tour committee la aware, that there are a
number of persons who claim to have conces
sions from the Government of Nicaragua and
("osta Rica, Investing them with rights to nav
lgatt the San Juan Kiver and Lake Nicaragua.
Others clidm to be authorized to construct this
e/r*-at waterway connecting the oceans. But It
is believed by your committee that these rights
have either lapsed or are of Inconsiderable
value, or Lave been obtained for epeculatlve
purposes. However this may be, It should be
the purpose of our Government to deal directly
â¢with the Governments of Nicaragua and Costa
J '-)Â¦Â«- These Governments can adjust ail ques
tions growing out of these concessions much
more easily than the United States. It Is not
believed that any one oÂ£ these real or alleged
concessionaires have any rights or Inteiests
that they can convey to the United States. And
It Is not deemed wife to hare any joint Inter
est or interests of copartnership, or any Interest
crowing out of corporate relations with any of
these iÂ»er&oas. It is our opinion thst the-peo
ple of the United Stales want a Government
canalâ one that will be ccrjpletely under the
control of Lee United States.
After alluding to possible International
objections to the building and control of
this canal by this nation alone owing to
the advantages that would accrue to the
United States navy the report says:

Former Treaty a "Dead" Letter.
There are persons who say that we are bound
by treaty stipulations with the Government of
Great Britain to- refrain from carryirrg out this
great enterprise. This statement we do not
believe. We recogr.fze tho fart that fifty years
ago the United States and Great Britain en
tered Into an alliance to wcure the building
of the. Nicaragua car.al. Any "person who dis
passionately studies carefully -that treaty must
comÂ© to the conclusion that the primary stipu
lations In the Clayton-Hulwer convention look
ed to the Immediate buildlnr of a canal undf>r
the Influences that might be exercised by the
two Governments rather than to a prohibition
of either to build it.
After quoting the treaty the report
goes on: Â¦
No one can read that article without con
cluding that the Nicaragua canal contemplated
was an undertaking early to be completed
through the kindly aid of the two govern
ment!'. Great Britain has allowed fifty years
to elapse without any movement on her part
to carry out the provisions of that article. It
has been a dead letter from the day the treaty
was siened to the present moment. And the
jirovif=!ons of the first article were agreed to
necessarily In connection with the seventh,
that neither government shall have . exclusive
control over said ship canal, being the ship
canal that was provided for in the seventh
article, and which the two- nations were to use
their friendly offices in Immediately securing.
Bit suppose this is not true and that we are
bound, as was Great Britain bound, not to se
cure the Nicaragua canal. This Nicaragua
canal tan properly be described in other words
by calling it "the short â¢ route .to the east";
and then, partly paraphrasing the sentence.
"Great Britain and the United States bound
themwlves not to secure, as against the other,
the short route to the east."
In ISiO the Nicaragua route was the only
'â¢short route to the east" that any man had
in his thoughts, and the spirit of the agree
ment was that Great Britain would not secure
the short route to the t-ast without the con
sent and co-operation of the United States.
But In violation of the spirit of the contract
Great Britain, through her control over the
Suez canal, secured for herself a short route
to the ea*t, one that is on her territory as
completely for all practical purposes as though
It was on the soil of Ireland; one that is com
pletely under the control of her guns at Gib
raltar and the Islands in the Mediterranean and
the Red Sea; and yet we are blandly told that
notwithstanding the failure on her part to
observe the letter of the seventh article and
the spirit of the first article we are bound by.
a treaty of alliance entered Into fifty years
ago. . -*Â¦ ?. .-. .-- - ;
Growth of Pacific Coast- Trade.
The last fifty years has wrought a remark
able change In our relations to a waterway
crossing the isthmus. Eighteen hundred and
fifty was only four years removed from our*
first occupation of California. It waa only
four years later than the passage of the first
party of emigrants from the Mississippi River
under the protection of a military force to
Oregon. It was but two years after the ces
sion of large landed interests on the Pacific
Coast from Mexico. It was only three years
after settlement of the disputed boundary of
our Northwest Pacific possessions.
In lSi.O not more than 10,000 inhabitants were
on the Pacific Coast. Our coastwise trade with
that coast was insignificant In value or amount.
Now we have millions of citizens living on
that coast. We have hundreds of millions of
commerce; we have thousands of millions of
wealth. We have acquired Alaska, Hawaii and
the Philippines. There !s no comparison be
tween the meager Interests of fifty years ago
acd the colossal Interests of to-day. The sit
uation hÂ«s so changed, the interests of our
people now and then axe so diverse, the neces
sity of responding to these changed conditions is
so overwhelming, that the most censorious of
those who lead In the formation of the world's
judgment would say that our present action must
be in harmony with these new conditions rather
than the old. There Is a law of self-preserva
tion that should control the action of com
munities, no lers than of individuals.
Irrepealable statutes are not tolerated. Even
the most solemnly enacted constitutions must
give way to the demand of the later generations
when it Is found that their provisions are harm
ful to the public welfare. And we know of no
other form of enactment having sanctity above
law and constitution that thÂ» overwhelming
needs of the people may not with consistency
and morality demand the repeal of.
Question of Fortifications.
In this connection the report quotes
Professor Lawrence In "Principles of. In
ternational Law/ In which he: discusses
the extent to which treaties are binding.'
The report then proceeds:
But we think It safe to say that neither the
United States nor Great Britain has continu
ously regarded the Clayton-Bulwer treaty as
In forre. In I*6B the United States and Nica
ragua exchanged ratifications of a treaty of
friendship commerce and navigation. It gives
to the United States the rf^ht to send its forces
Into Nicaragua to defend the citizens of the
United State* and their property, the property
In contemplation being the Nicaragua cr.nal.
The use of a military force always Implies the
right to establish fortifications for defensive
pur noses.
Now is it possible that the TJnite.l State*
would at that early day^-only peventeoi years
after the negotiation of the Clayton-Bulwer
conventionâ have secured from Nicaragua the
right thus to use her military forces If 'tne
authorities did not believe the Clayton-Bulwt-r
treaty was abrocated?
But again, at an earlier period â In IS6oâ Great
Britain herself concluded a treaty with the
State of Xicarajrua. Will it be contended" that
Great Britain had the right Jo secure, from
Nicaragua an agreement that she might enter
with her military forces the territory of Nica
ragua and use her military forces for the de
fense of her people and her property, lnclud
lns the right to build such fortifications as
might be needed for her military forces, and
yet the provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
It Is doubtless true that In ISSO Great Britain
and the United States contemplated the speedy
completion of the Nicaragua canal. They pro
posed to have joint Interests, by Joint contri
butions to It. But the possibilities of a Suez
canal, that followed years after ISSO, daw:ud
upon the maritime world and changed the In
ternets of Great Britain. She no longer de
sired the Nicaragua canal for her own uses.
She directed her conduct with reference to the
new conditions, yet ctlll uses this Khott of a
dead treaty to frighten the people of the United
States from securing; the advantages certain to
flow to us from the successful completion of
this rreat undertaking. ;. â¢ '.

TRAMPS FIGHT
WITH TRAIN CREW
*
Used Guns When Or
dered From a Car.
Â¦ Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSON. Ariz., Feb. 17.â The crew of
the' east-bound Southern Pacific fast
freight had an exciting experience last
night at Red Rock. A brakeman found
that an empty stock car was occupied by
eight tramps and he ordered them from
the car. They refused to go, and Con
ductor D. M. Conway decided to switch
the car off at Red Rock, in order to get
rid of the tramps without trouble.
The hobos realized that they were be
lnc left and attempted to board the train
when It was starting. The crew beat
them off and the tramps pulled guns and
began firing at the trainmen. A^ number
of shots were fired, but none of the train
men were Injured. Brakeman Acton says
that five shots passed close to his head.
â¢The trainmen rushed to the end of the
train and, arming .themselves, drove the
tramps from the train. The tramps were
all armed and are still at large. Two of
the party were captured by the train
men and . brought here to-day.
to Helena and return. The next .time he
met Marcyes he told him he was obliged
to him. That was the extent of his con
versation with Marcyes.
"It is absolutely false that I held up my
hand, indicating that Marcyes could have
$10,000 for his vote, as Cason testified, nor
did I by any movement or word of lip in
dicate that I expected him to secure a
vote for me for a corrupt consideration,"
said Clark. ' .
Clark admitted that he had thought well
of Cason not only because of the letter of
identification he brought but because Ca
son had been with his friends in a" com
bination of Democrats and -Republicans
in a campaign in Butte.
In reply to a suggestion from Chandler,
Clark said he had written a letter to the
Republican caucus of tho Montana Legis
lature outlining his attitude on the tarltl.
The question had first arisen in tho legis
lative campaign In Yellowstone County,
and he had at that early date written a
letter to Foster of that county. Writing
to the chairman of tho Republican cau
cus he had reiterated the views expressed
in the Foster letter. He had not preserved
a copy of the letter, but If one could" be
found he would be glad to produce it.
Chandler insisted that the letter should
be found, as It was evidence of tho pledge
he made to secure Republican votes.
Clark said he had sent the letter to
Hobson, chairman of the Republican cau
cus. Clark stated the contents of the let
ter to the caucus. He said that he had
taken the position that "In the distribu
tion of the duties on various articles ho
thought that raw materials should be
provided for and share in the advantage
of the protective tariff to the extent of
materials produced in our own State,
such as wool, lead, hides and barley."
Returning to Cason, Clark said ho had
sent hinr a check for $500 after the ad
journment of the Legislature. This he
had done because Cason had complained
to him of the condition of his finances and
because of the good opinion he had of
him.
Speaking of the Republican votes cast
for him, Clark said he had told all Repub
lican members of the Legislature that he
would not accept their voieÃ if they would
Insure his election unless he could get a
majority of the Republican caucus. Hia
reason was that to accept fewer than a
majority of the caucus would subject
them to accusations of accepting bribes.
"There was so much scandal at the
time," he said, "that I thought It right
to protect them. I wanted to have the
election beyond reproach and I did not
want to compromise any of these peo
ple."
He had meant to adhere to this position
even if he had fallen only one short of
a majority of the Republican caucus.-
Blckford Did the Work.
The letters to and from Dr. Ector were
then taken up. Explaining one of his let
ters to the doctor, he said he thought the
matter related to Representative Woods
and that Bickford was looking after that
matter, hence the expression in his letter
that "that matter is left entirely in the
hands of Bickford." He had not known
that Woods was in debt, as that subject
had never been brought to his attention.
He had heard that Bickford would look
after Woods' vote. He had had no con
versation with Woods until after the leg
islative election.
Clark said he was in the habit of turn-
Ing matters of detail over to others who
had particular matters in hand. He. had.
he knew, spoken to Bickford on the sub
ject and he thought it probable that he
had turned the letter over to him.
"Mr. Blckford," Clark said. In reply to
a question from Senator Hoar, "was the
only one I knew well in Mr. Woods' local
ity, and I would likely turn the matter
over to him. He had no authority to act
for me except in a legitimate way. All I
expected was that he should hold Woods
In line and prevent the people by whom
he was surrounded, who were unfriendly
to me, from getting Woods away from
me. He was authorized to use only per
suasive means and was not authorized to
use any money. I had nothing improper
In my mind and I had no reason. to sup
pose that Blckford had anything Improper
In his mind."
He knew nothing, he said, of the in
debtedness on Woods' ranch, which it was
proposed should be carried for him.
"Nothing was said to me by any living
person which. would lead me to suspect or
suppose that such a condition existed," he
said.
It was a surprise to him when the de
tails of the transaction for the relief of
Woods' mortgage by his son and Blck
ford was brought out . In the testimony.
Questioned closely upon Blckford hav
ing taken $7000 to Mlssoula to lift Woods'
mortgage. Clark repeated that he had not
at the time known anything whatever
about It. He had not known that his son
had given the money to Bickford until
the matter was brought out in the testi
mony here.
"Did your pon have access to your ac
counts, co that he could have given Blck
ford that amount of money in your In
terest?" asked Hoar.
"The son is a man of wealth himself,
said Faulkner.
"Let the witness answer, said Senator
Chandler.
Clark said: "My son had drawn checks
on my account, but he did not do bo In
this case. He could easily have drawn
this amount of money on his own ac
count."
Expense Money for Friends.
In reply to a question, he said that his
son had not, even since the facts of this
transaction were brought In this Inquiry,
explained to him. He. had not paid Bick
ford anything for his service, except his
expenses and his regular salary. .
Replying to a question by Faulkner con
cerning the relation to himself of his son,
C W Clark. Wellcome, Blokford, A. J.
Davidson, A. J. Steele, William McDer
mott and others. Senator. Clark said:
'â¢They stood to me In the relation of
friends, promoting my political; Interests,
and some of them composed 1 a committee
which had undertaken to disburse funds
In the campaign and which was author
ized to look after matters generally."
"Had they any authority to do anything
in a financial way more than to pay in
cidental expenses?'*^ _
"They had not, if I am to understand
your question to be whether they had
authority to pay out money for unlawful
purposes. They had no authority to pay
out money for any other than fair and
legitimate purposes." Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
The examination in chief was concluded
In executive session the committee de
cided not to receive Falk's testimony
concerning Whiteside's reported effort at
bribery as purely collateral testimony, but
It is understood that notice has been given
of a motion for reconsideration. The com
mittee also discussed the question of the
advisability of sending for witnesses for
the purpose of Impeaching the testimony
of witnesses already heard, but reached
no conclusion on this point. There arÂ©
about thirty such witnesses wanted on
each side and the expense of bringing
them would be about $18,000 or $20,000.

tutlon and Senator Clark Is its president.
The witness said Martin had come to his
office and, requesting an Interview, had
shown him a letter signed by Clark, one
sentence of which was as follows:
"See Justice Brantley and ask him not
to allow that good man Wellcome to be
disbarred."
After reading the letter Justice Brant
ley said he handed it back, saylDg he was
only one member of the court and could
not control Its action, nor would he If he
could. He had also assured Dr. Martin
that there was no prejudice in the court
against Wellcome and that he would have
a fair trial.
The Chief Justice said that he was not
sure that the letter shown him by Martiln
was in Clark's handwriting. The inter
view had occurred In his office in Helena
during the latter part of October last.
Senator Chandler announced that Mar
tin had been sent for and that Tracey was
now on his way to Washington.
Faulkner then asked for a decision as
to whether Ben Fa Ik was to be allowed
to testify concerning Whlteside's alleged
effort at the bribery of himself (Falk).
This raised the question as to how many
witnesses should be called for impeach
ment purposes. Faulkner said he desired
to impeach the testimony of only three
witnessesâ Whiteside. Clark of Madison
County and Jackson of Salt Lake City.
Campbell said he would not call any im
peachment witnesses providing the White
side episode were not entered upon. The
decision of the question was again de
ferred and Senator Clark vras called to
the stand.
Clark's appearance caused a ripple of
interest throughout the room. After hav
ing been sworn the Senator took his seat
quietly, and Faulkner Immediately began
his questions, the f'.rst of which brought
out the facts concerning Clark's career,
political and otherwise. In Montana. He
said he had resided in Montana since 18S3,
most of the time in Butte, and had been
engaged In many occupations, the princi
pal of which were merchandising, bank
ing, mining and the reduction of ores. He
had, he said, taken an active part In poli
tics, especially for the past fifteen years.
Sought to Crush Dalyism.
Coming to the campaign of IS9S. he said
he had entered it at the solicitation of a
number of friends, who had asked him
to help them organize the State against
what was called the "Daly power," which
he agreed to do. with their aid and as
sistance. He referred to the preliminary
meeting of his friends, the particulars of
which were related by Governor Hauser,
in which he agreed to pay all the expenses
If the others would do the organizing and
perform the work necessary In the cam
paign.
Relating further the motives actuating
him In entering into this campaign with
a few of the State officers and members
of the Legislature, he Bald he had sent
out some irlends to feel the pulse of the
State. Democratic politics In the State
had been running wild for come years.
The Democrats had been fusing with
Populists and Silver Republicans, and he
was opposed to such a course, because It
resulted In the nomination of persons who
were not Democrats. The object was to
so organize as to break down the "one
man power" In the State. After ascer
taining these facts, the Senator eaid he
had very reluctantly agreed to the propo
sition of his friends, and to assist finan
cially furnished such funds as were abso
lutely necessary in a prudent way to ac
complish the object aimed at.
Clark said that at this preliminary
meeting he had stated distinctly that he
would not be a candidate for the Senate,
and that he had not changed his mind
until after the election of the Legisla
ture.
"Did you." In accoordance with your
agreement with your friends, at that
meeting make any contribution to the
campaign fund?" Faulkner asked.
"Yes, sir," was the reply. "After this
meeting I gave an amount which it was
estimated woujd be necessary to begin
with. That amount was $30,000. The sec
ond contribution was made in October,
and amounted to $20,000. In November I
contributed 540.0<X>, and after I was elected
I gave my son, C. W. Clark, a check for
about $20,503 to pay expenses Incurred dur
ing the sitting of the Legislature In He
lena. Upon leaving that city I had told
my son to stay there and settle up all
bills that had been Incurred. Upon his
return to Butte he gave me a statement
showing disbursements amounting to
about this sum. These four contributions
were all that were made by me In con
nection with that campaign.
Explaining to Senator Hoar, Clark said
that the first contribution of $35,000 was
necessary in organizing for the legislative
campaign, a great deal of money being re
quired to get voters registered and to get
them to the polls.
"Did you ever," asked Faulkner, "di
rectly or indirectly make any money or
other voluntary contributions to secure
the vote of any member of the Legisla
ture for you for United States Senator?"
"No, sir: I never did." responded the
witness, holding himself erect and look-
Ing directly at his interrogator.
"Do you know of your own personal
knowledge of any money being used to
corruptly influence votes In your behalf?"
was the next question.
"I do not. There were plenty of rumors
about the expenditure of money, but I
have no personal knowledge of anything
of that kind being done."
Contradicts Whiteside.
Senator Clark was questioned concern
ing his conversation with Senator White
side and Mark Hewitt and his reported
conversation with Representative Jackson
of Utah. He denied having had any con
versation with Jackson, and. while admit
ting having talked with Whiteside and
Hewitt, he contradicted all the statements
made by them in their testimony which
would in any way Implicate him with cor
rupt methods In the Legislature. He said
that on one occasion he had met White
side at the Helena Hotel, when the latter
had come to him, saying: â¢
"I have good news tor you. X hare la-
duced Senator Anderson to vote for you."
Senator Clark said he had told White
side that he was pleased to hear this, be
cause he and Anderson had long been
friends and ho had confidently counted
upon his vote before the final ballot
should be taken. Clark said, positively,
that Anderson was the only member of
the Legislature spoken of in this conver
sation, and he explicitly denied having
said that Anderson could not be Influenced
by money "like other members." HÂ© de
nied having told Whiteside that C. W.
Clark, Wellcome or any one else was his
agent.
Clark admitted that he had met
Mark. Hewitt often during the sitting of
the Legislature, as Hewitt had professed
to be a friend of his in his Senatorial
contest. Their conversations had. how
ever, been so completely devoid of feat
ure that he did not remember any of
them. He was sure he had never told
Hewitt, as the latter had testified, that he
considered Whlteside reliable, for he had
not talked with him concerning Whiteside.
He had never told Hewitt after the White
side so-called exposure that they would
make the people believe that Daly had
furnished the $30,000 used by Whiteside in
that exposure, and he had never told
Hewitt that he would have his son or
Wellcome or any one else see Tom Lyons
with a view of satisfying him. He did,
however, remember that Hewitt had told
him that Lyons was making some trouble
about his expenses In the Senatorial cam
paign.
With reference to the testimony of Leg
islator Jackson of Utah Clark said he had
no recollection whatever of having met
that gentleman and that he was sure that
he (Clark) had not tried to influence Jack
son to vote for McCune for United States
Senator from Utah. He was equally sure
that he had made no corrupt or improper
proposals to Jackson in that connection
and that he had not told him that he
(Clark) had just purchased the voto of
a member of the Montana Legislature in
his own behalf.
Equally certain was he thathehaJnjver
said to Jackson or any one else that Sen
ator Hanna of Ohio had secured hiÂ«> elec
tion to the Senate by corrupt means.
"I am absolutely positive, said Senator
Clark, concluding his direct testimony con
cerning Jackson, "that I never had any
conversation with him or any one else
relative to the manner of Senator
Hanna's election, and I want to Bay that
every word of Jackson's testimony which
related to me was absolutely false."
That Letter to Dr. Martin.
At this Juncture a member of the com
mittee asked Clark In regard to the letter
to Dr. Martin of the Montana College
concerning which Justice Brantley had
testified earlier in the day. Clark replied
that he had no recollection concerning the
letter. He thought he might have whitten
it, as his relations with Dr. Martin were
very Intimate, as were also his relations
with Judge Brantley, and as he knew the
relationship to be so between Martin and
Brantley.
"1 may have written the letter to Martin
to see Justice Brantley," said Senator
Clark, "but I certainly eld not go to the
extent of asking him* to suggest to Judge
Brantley that the proceedings against
Wellcome should be stopped. I admit that
I was greatly interested in Wellcome's
case, being convinced, as the letter re
ferred to says, that he is both a grand and
a good man. I do not, however, wiah to
be understood. If I did write the letter,
as suggesting any means of approaching
him which were not perfectly legitimate.
As to recollecting whether I wrote the
letter. 1 repeat that I cannot say positive
ly. My correspondence is probably as
large as that of almost any other man In
the United States. 1 write from fifty to
one hundred letters a day, and it is not
probable that I would remember whether
I had written this letter on a matter
which I did not consider very Important.
If I did write It, I simply did so to have
Dr. Martin use his influence with Jud?s
Brantley to see that justice was done Mr.
Wellcome."
Faulkner asked Clark concerning his ac
quaintance with Rev. B. E. H. Warren,
the Methodist minister who testified for
the prosecution. Clark said Warren ha<l
come to him during the Senatorial content
expressing great interest in his campaign
and had told him that there was a mem
ber of the Legislature, whose name he did
not mention, whose vote could be had ior
Clark.
"I told him," said Clark, "that would
be nice and that I would like to have the
vote. Mr. Warren then said that to gÂ«t
the vote would require some money. I
told him," Clark went on, "that I did not
expect to secure any votes as the result
of a pecuniary consideration."
After that Warren had asked him for a
contribution for his church and had asked
him to send the check, if he gave one at
all, to him personally. He had promised
to do this, and had afterward sent him a
check for $100 for the church, making it
payable' to Warren personally. He hud
never had any more conversations than
this with Warren, and he pronounced as
absolutely false the statement made liy
Warren that he (Clark) had urged him
afterward to get for him the vote of the
member he had spoken of. Referring to
Warren's statement that his sons had
been discharged from employment at
Clark's instance, Clark said he did not
know that Warren had any sons.
Cason's Accusation Denied.
Speaking of his relations with the wit
ness Cason, Clark said Cason had brought
a letter of identification from his brother
in-law. Cason had told him that Repre
eentatlve Marcyes (R.) was a warm
friend of his and that he (Cason) could
be of benefit to him in getting Marcyes'
vote. Clark said that afterward, when he
found that he could not be elected by
Democratic votes, he sent for Cason and
asked him to use , his. â¢ influence with
Marcyes. After having seen Marcyes, Ca
son told him that he had found that mem
ber very friendly to him (Clark). He then
told Cason to go to his son or. some one
else and get money to pay his expenses
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.â Senator
Clark of Montana, was on the
witness ptand before the Sen
ate Committee on Elections for
about four hours to-day and
when the committee adjourned for the
<lay only his examination in chief had
t>e*n completed, leaving his cross-exam
ination for next Monday. His testimony
related solely to the charges made
against him in connection with his elec
tion by tlve Legislature of Montana to
thÂ« Vnltcd States Senate during its sit
ting last winter. He denied explicitly
And categorically all the charges that by
himself or with his connivance or con
rent members of the Legislature were
corrupted In his behalf, contradicting
many of the statements made by wit
nesses for the prosecution. He admitted
having paid out an aggregate of about
1115,000 during the campaign, but said
these expenditures were for legitimate
purposes only. The large outlay was due
to the fact, he said, that he had con
tracted to pay all the expenses of a cam
paign against Daly's rule In the State
end he had gone Into the compact to that
because he considered Daly's ruU
Tyrannical and opposed to the best in
terests of the State. Chief Justice Brant
ley also was on the stand a part of the
<!ay.
When the proceedings opened Justice
PlffTOtt of the Montana Supreme Court
â¢was recalled to make some additions to
his testimony. HÂ© said, among other
things, that he and Justice Hunt had
consulted as to the wisdom of criminal
proceedings against Dr. Tracey on ac
count of his advances toward Judge Hunt
In connection with the Wellcome disbar
ment case. He said the consultation had
r*een more a matter of speculation than
anything else, and that both seemed to
roncur that the situation old not call for
Fuch, action, as they thought Dr. Tracey
was more Ginned against than sinning.
Justice Plggott added to the portion of
his testimony concerning Justice Hunt's
Â«-:a.tement of his interview with Dr.
Tracey, fa-ying that he had been im
pressed by Hunt's statement that there
â¢â¢was a party over here." Hunt made
that remark In Helena, coming from
Hutte, and, therefore, the expression

that his mind was not yet clear on that
point; that he had no belief on the sub-

Justice Brantley Testifies.
Justice PiÃKott was followed by Chief
Justice Theodore Brantley. also of tne
Mcntana State Supreme Court, making
the third and last member of that body
to be PxamirK'd in this case. He said that
on August b last, when Justice Hunt had
hi? interview with Dr. Tracey and Justice
Pipg-ott his interview with Oorbett. ho
â¢was on the Pacific Coast. He had just
heard of th^ Hunt-Tracey interview upon

Justice Hum had th^n made a full state

with Justice Pipgott as to the wisdom
of rrcceed'.r.c againtt Tracey. They had

Mr. C. K. Cosby, Vale Mill. Term.,
\ writes:
"Five years ago I contracted a -very bad
case of kidney trouble and constipation. I
was expected to die by' an my friends, but
to the surprise of all I still live, thanks to
Peruna."
Mr. Samuel Sanders, of Blythedals. Mo.,
says:
"My disease was catarrh, of the urethra
and bladder. I got a bottle of Peruna and
began taking It. and In a few days I was
relieved and could sleep and rest all night.
I think that Peruna is a valuable rem-
edy."
The following letter was recently re-
ceived by Dr. Hartman, the compounder
of the great catarrh remedy, Peruna.
ROCKPORT. VT. Va.. July 13. 1599.
Dear Doctor Hartman â I send you this
testimonial, prompted by ths gratitude*
of my heart. I can truly say that Pe-
runa is a great medicine. Before I com-
menced taking It I had systemic catarrh
and was In poor health. Since I hava
been taking Peruna I feel like a new
person. I have a good appetite, sleep
well, my food digests well, and I believe-
in, a short time that I will be entirely
well. I heartily recommend Peruna to
all teachers and students aa a great tonic
for the whole system. Yours gratefully,
C. E. DEEM.
Mr. Deem is a teacher in tho common
schools of Wood County. "West Virginia.
A book on the different phases and
complications of catarrh, written by Dr.
Hartman, will be sent free to any ad-
dress by The Peruna Medicine Company,
Columbus, Ohio.
tlon that Peruna Is one of the finest pat-
ent medicines I have ever taken. I feel In
every way better than I have for years.
You are at liberty to use my name to fur-
ther the sale of your remedy."
A remedy to cure catarrh of these differ-
ent organs must be a remedy that acts di-
rectly on the mucous membranes lining
thesa organs. It must be an Internal sys-
temic remedy. It is claimed for Peruna
that it cures catarrh wherever located.
The following- unsolicited words from tha
people indicate whether this Is a trua
statement or not:
Mr. T. P. Faltz, of Sllverton, Va.. writes
the following:
"Peruna Is just what you and others
recommend It to be. I used your Peruna
for catarrh of the eyes according to your
directions, and I am now welL Mr eyes
were red and I couldn't stand the sun-
light. The lids of my eyes were thick, and
some mornlnss I couldn't open tham. At
times I couldn't see out of one of them.
I tried every remedy I could hear of and
then failed.
"The first bottle of Peruna did me morÂ«
jrood than all thÂ« rest of the medicines I
had taken. I used only four bottles and
now lam a well man. lam telling others
what It has dons for me."

TWO FOOTPADS
LANDED IN JAIL
Passed Themselves Off
as Officers.
Special Dispatch to The Call
WOODLAND, Feb. 17âConstable John
son of Davisville landed two desperate
robbers in the County Jail to-day.
They held up a miner south of the rail
road depot at Davisville about 9 o'clock
Friday night. They personated officers.
One of them drew his revolver and mado
the stranger hold up his hands while they
searched him. He had IS 10 in his pock
ets, which they secured. After the rob
bery they made a pretense of being len
ient with him. While insisting that he
was a bad man they gave him the. option
of leaving the county with all possible
haste or of being locked up in the branch
jail. He made a pretense of accepting the
former alternative, but after crossing the
railroad bridge he went up the creek a
short distance, crossed over and returned
to Davisville, where he found Constable
Johnson.
The officer disguised the miner and the
two went in search of the robbers.. They
came upon them just as they were leav
ing the lumber yard to ride out of town
on the brakebeam of a freight car.
When discovered one of the men made
an effort to draw his pistol, but Constable
Johnson, who was within three feet of
him and had him covered with his revol
ver, commanded him to throw up his
bands and he obeyed. The officer hand
cuffed them together and relieved them
of their pistol, after which he searched
them and recovered all the stolen money
except 5 cents.
Believing them to be" secure. Constable
Johnson relaxed his vigilance and put his
revolver In his coat pocket. Without
warning the two robbers suddenly at
tacked him with the evident Intention of
securing the weapon and compelling him
at the point of the weapon to unlock the
handcuffs. They would probably have suc
ceeded but for the timely interference of
the miner.
With their disengaged hands they
seized the officer and pinioned his arms in
such a way that, although he had hold of
his revolver he could not draw it. The
miner clubbed one of them on the head
and he fell to the ground. Mr. Johnson
struck the other fellow with the butt of
his revolver and both were laid out.

PITTSBURG, Feb. 17.â The acceptance

suit clears the way for the actual be
ginning of the fight In the courts between
the two steel kings. The recognized ad
herents of each are doing all in their
power to # marshal their reserve forces for
the contest, and consultations on cam
paign plans are being held night and day.
The fifteen days allowed for filing an
answer to the suit date* back from yes

the expiration of the time limit, however,
as the counsel for Carnegie say all the
papers will be ready when he returns

ately after Carnegie reaches Plttsburg hÂ«
will go over the papers with his attor

The defense. It Is said, will be In thÂ»
nature of a general denial of all the al
legations of Krick as to Carnegie's ma

that the "iron-clad" contract still exists
and la as forcible and binding as it was

WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.-The House
sub-committee on naval affairs having
charge of the appropriation bill has
agreed on an apropriatlon of $210,165 for
the support of the navy yard at Port Or

the estimate recommended by the Navy

The appropriation for the Mare Island

MR. McKINLEY'S
INSULAR POLICY
Views He Is Said to Have
Expressed.
>TEW YORK, Feb. 17.â The World to- j
morrow will publish a summary of a long
statement made by President McKlnley
to Henry Loomis Nelson as to the Ameri
can policy toward the newly acquired isl
ands. The article is vouched for as an
authoritative interpretation of the Presi
dent's views. According to Nelson, "It Is
Mr. McKinley's belief, and It will be his
purpose to carry the belief into opera
tion, that the constitution does not apply
to any ' of our new islands;' that those
peoples are not fit for self-government be
yond that proposed fÂ«r Hawaii; that our
new possessions must not be permitted
to injure any of our protected interests,
and that free trade with Porto Rico Is
right, because our protected interests will
not be injured thereby."
The President believes â and this Is the
most important statement that can pos
sibly be made touching his present be
liefsâthat Congress has plenary power
over Hawaii, Porto Rico and the Philip
pines. He holds that Congress may pass
one tariff law for Porto Rico, another for
Hawaii, another for the Philippines, and
that all may be different from that of the
United States. It does not appear likely
to his mind that any question can ever
arise as to the civil rights of the people
of these places.
"Mr. McKinley's attitude, then, toward
the natives ia benevolent, lie desires to
elevate them, to educate them, and he
hopes that, in the end, they will become
worthy of being intrusted with local self
government. He does not think any of
these natives worthy now, except the few
in Hawaii upon whom it is intended to
bestow the suffrage â a few more than
possessed the suffrage under the Dole
Government.
But the main purpose of the President
is to deal with the islands as markets for
American products, and as the subjects
of commercial exploitation generally.
The President is a thorough believer in
the moral and intellectual value of com
merce, and he proceeds on the theory
that when a nation is doing well as a
buyer and seller it is presumably well
governed and its people are morally
sound.
Â¦ He looks forward to benefiting the na
tives by expanding thÂ» blessings of
Protestant Christianity and civilization
by means of commerce.
"It is important to digress a moment,"
says Mr.- Nelson, "for the purpose of say
ing that the President .is largely under the
influence of certain clergymen, one of
whom considers that he is the chosen
champion of Protestantism in its imag
inary war with Romanism, and this ac
counts in a large measure for his convic
tion that in spreading Christianity and
civilization among the heathen he is gain
ing and keeping the approval of good
Americans. Mr. McKinley Is a loyal
Methodist and is naturally stirred and
moved by the enthusiasm and spirit of
that denomination.
"It does not follow, on the President's
theory, that if free trade is established
between this country and Porto Rico there
should not be a protective tariff against
the products of the Philippines and Cuba,
for Cuba is talked about, naturally, in
administration circles and in Congress as
if its annexation to this country were a
matter of course.
"Onu thing is settled definitely in re
spect to the Philippines. .* The open door
is not to be applied to them. The Repub
lican party will not consent to give to the
Asiatic world an opportunity to land its
goods in the Philippines free of duty, to
enjoy whatever modified tariff there may
be established between the Philippines
and this country."
STOCKTON. Feb. 17.â Dr. William McNaul, a well-known practitioner of San
Miguel, and Miss Sara McCain, daughter of William McCain, a wealthy
resident of Southern Monterey County, were quietly married in this city
Thursday at the residence of the bride's sister, Mrs. F. A. Guernsey. The
doctor is favorably known in San Miguel and of late has been attend-
Ing a course of special lectures at the University of California. When he
resumes his practice at home it will also be to leave his bachelor apartments
for the more congenial sphere of domesticity. The bride is a young lady of mark
ed grace and intellectual accomplishments. She was raised in Monterey County,
where her father is a large land owner and stock raiser.
The couple will return to San Miguel after a trip to the southland. It is whis
pered that the announcement will come as a surprise to friends of both bride
and groom.
CONFERENCE ON
CURRENCY BILL
Many Differences to Be
Adjusted.
>
WASHINGTON. F,eb. 17.â The Republi
can members of the conference committee
having charge of the financial bill held a
protracted session to-day, beginning at 11
a, m. and lasting until shortly before 6
p. m. During part of this time Secretary
Gage was present, having been invited
to give his views upon certain features
of the measure. At the close of the day's
session It was said by members of the
conference thaf no conclusion had been
reached on the bill as a whole or on
any single proposition, the entire time
having been given to preliminary discus
sion on the general principles involved.
Secretary Gage was called In to give
Information concerning administrative
features of the bill, the Issue of notes and
other matters of a technical nature relat
ing to carrying out the provisions of the
bill when it should become a law.
The conference went over both the
House and Senate bills and it was found
that differences exist all along the line.
The House conferees insisted that their
measure best met the requirements of the
situation and the Senators were equaJly
firm in standing by their Mil. Strenuous
objection Is made by the House conferees
to the bimetallic section of the Senate
bill end they also oppose the refunding
section of the bill. The conference did
not reach a stage where any proposition
to adjust any of the differences was fa
vorably considered. It is not meant that
there is a deadlock, because the consid
eration has not reached that stage. The
conference will continue on Monday.

Newspaper Comment, Generally
Speaking, Is Losing thÂ« Tone
3 of Bitterness Toward
the British.
Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Feb. 17.â Colonial matters en
grossed the attention of the Reichstag
this week, the debate unmistakably show
ing the unprofitable state of the colonies
hitherto, even In the case of the most
promising, like the Cameroons. It like
wise showed the growing appropriations,
with stationary or diminishing exports
and imports.
Official reports demonstrate that famine
and sickness in German East Africa has
devastated that colony. In the district of
Tanga, for example, within the year 1899,
the population has been diminished from
123,3wi 10 b1,325, owing to" famine, leprosy,
smallpox and typhoid fever. .
The condition of the whole' colony ap
pears appalling. The trade of this colony,
which Is thrice the size of Germany, is
magnificent and mostly with British In
dia, while the cos to Germany is five
fold the whole tra> â¢.. The reports from
the other colonies aie not much better.
The Cologne Yolks Zeitung says the
railroad projects for the colonies now
adopted amount to 200,000,000 marks, while,
on the other hand, German trade with the
British colonies amounts to 600,000,000
murks, without entailing a cent of ex
pense.
i It cannot be denied that the sentiment is
erowinf? and obtaining in a large part of
the nation that other methods tnan those
employed are needed to make the German
colonies a success. It was significant
tnat during the several days' debate in
the Reichstag the Government remained
on the defensive. Thus the colonial de
bate nas in no way strengthened the
chances of the naval bill. Dr. Barth, the
Freisinnlge leader, however, believes the
bill will pass, though the situation is mud
dled about the uncertainty as to the Cen
ter's position. Dr. I^ieber. the Center
leader, is dangerously ill and there is no
body in authority in the party with whom
the Government and the other parties can
negotiate. Some are pulling one way and
the others are pulling another way.
'i'he South African war news and occur
rences in the British Parliament are
greedily read and commented upon. A
number of the leading German papers to
day still affect to believe the relief of
Kimberley is only a ruse by which the
Boers have led the British into a trap, as
at Spion Kop.
Generally speaking, though, the German
newspaper comment now lacks the bitter
ness of tone toward the British which
was noticeable until recently. A num
ber of papers, especially the Agrarian and
Pan-German, insist that the war must
continue until Great Britain's military
collapse Is laid bare before the world, thus
preventing Great Britain for a century
to come from interfering in South Africa
and leave the white population of Low
German stock lords there. At the Foreign
Office these day dreams are ridiculed.
The Foreign Office, however, does not
doubt the relief of Kimberley, and con
siders it a great moral success for Great
Britain.
Terrific snowstorms have prevented the
Emperor from having much sport in llu
bertusstock, though this morning he went
out on foot with a small retinue, deer
stalking toward "Waldau.
The court marshals here say that
though the official court mourning is now
over, no balls or court festivals will be
held for the balance of the season, and
the carnival ball arranged for February
27 will be omitted out of respect for the
demise of the â¢Empress' mother.
The reception of the United States Em
bassador, Andrew D. White, and Mrs.
White on Washington's birthday will oc
cur if Mr. "White recovers in time, and a
"hop" at the Kaiserhof will follow. Mr.

A MIXED AUDIENCE
San Diego Normal School GirlsTorcea
to Give Up Basket-Ball Cham

Specla! DltD*tch to The CaH.
SAN DIEGO. Feb. 17.â Because the pre
ceptress of the San Diero Normal School
placed a. veto on the basket-ball girls
playiny before a mix<"d audience the team
wae compelled to forfeit the championship
to the girls of the High School this after
noon, because the latter appeared on the
court and the former did not. Both the
High School and the Normal have strong
twms, and there has been considerable
rivalry between them. A month ago an
a*rrÂ«erm-nt was entered Into between the
two teams that they should play three
Fames for the championship.

ADVERTS TO OHIO POLITICS

CLAIMS HANNA DEPENDED THE
OIL COMBINE.
la Rsturn, He Is Accused of Resort

Vice Presidential As
pirations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Feb. T}.â Late this
afternoon the House passed the legisla
tive, executive and judiciary bill, after
having had it under consideration lor
four days. A spirited colioo.uy betwten
Sulzer (D.) of New York and Grosvenor
(R.) cf Ohio was the feature of to-day's
session. Fresh from the anti-trust confer
ence in Chicago. Sulzer directed the atten
tion of the House to the "monster monop
olies." which he said were fostered by the
Republican administration. He adverted,
in passing, to Ohio politics.
These utterances drew the fire of Gen
eral Grosvenor. who referred to the "polit
ical Â«axbÂ»ge" which Sulzer had brought
back to Washington after his "hippodrom
ing tour" through the West as a "Vice
Pre*ldÂ«ntial candidate."
ThÂ« civil service appropriation, wliich
â¢was stricken out of the appropriation bill
In committee of the whole, was restoiAtl
in the House by a vote of 77 to 123.
In order to present his views upon trusts
ard the financial bill, which Is now in con
ference. Miers of Indiana offered an
amendment. He antagonized the provision
of tho financial bill which authorized na
tional banks to issue currency, and de
nounced the fastening of the gold stand
ard upon the people as a glaring iniquity.
He declared that the retirement of green
backs and the placing of the national
banks above the Government waÂ« the
completion of the most woeful blunder of
the age. Miers declared that after the
passage of the McKinley tariff law thirty
four new trusts were organized, and since
the McKinley administration had assumed
power and the Dlngley law had gone into
effect 200 of Â»uch "monsters" had raised
their head* In the country, with a capital
aggregating JT.000.000.000.
Sulzer, after directing attention to the
recent anti-trust conference held In Chi
cago, declared that thÂ« trusts were not
only doing irreparable damage, but doing
it through the backing of a Republican
administration.
"The administration Is responsible for
the trusts." said Sulzer. "It stands sponsor
fcr them and refuses to do anything to
suppress them. The greatest of all the^e
trusts is the money trust, and the conf^r
<>nce at Chicago unanimously condemned
the gigantic iniquity."
Sulzer then had read the resolutions
passt-d t>v the anti-trust conference. He.
continued:
"I desire to say to the prentlenjin
(Grosvenori that the chainr-an of trat
conference was a former Attorney General
of Ohio (Mr. Mor.n^tt). who was turned
corn by the Republican boss, liark Eian
na. because hr- had the courage of his
convictions and instituted action against
the Standard OH Company. If the Attor
ney General of the United States wore
honest enough to do his duty every trust
in the country would be broken, and if
Mr. Monnett had been backed by hi? party
the Standard Oil monopoly would now be
out of business."
In conclusion. Sulzer dared the Repub
licans to pass the financial bill. It would
be a eipnal to the American people to
ris=e up and put into the White House
"that peerless statesman and man of ir
reproachable character, William J.
Brvan."
Gro?=vÂ«>nor replied in a humorous vwn,
advening: to Sulzer's aspirations to the
Vice Presidency, and saying that after
Su!zcr had been "hippodroming about the
country" he had come back to Washing
ton loaded down with a lot of "political
garbage."
In answer to a question of Sulzer.he
said that Monnett had not been renoml
nated for Attorney General of Ohio be
cauFe he had already served two terms
and bad stepped aside in response to an
unwritten law of Ohio Republicans. He
referred to Monnett as a "very bright
young man." and declared that Senator
Hanna had had not the slightest thlr.g
to do with what Eulzer had termed Mon
nett'f "turning down." The Ohioan paid
tribute to Attorney General Grigpe, de
claring that a better lawyer and a clearer
headed administrator cf justice had never
been known in the department of Justice.
He closed by Faying that the Democrats
had ample opportunity between 18?2 and
IÂ«Â«5 to enforce the anti-trust laws, but
had failed to do s>o.
-The American people know that, he
ea'.d "and they know also that between
1&32 and WMi business broke down, people
starved and everything in general went
to the devil."
In reply. Sulzer said: "The American
people will not accept the brutal dictation
cf the gentleman from Ohio (Grosvenor)
and his master. Mark Hanna."
Cannon poured oil on the troubled wat.
Â«rs In an amuping EpÂ»tcn, in which he
appealed to the belligerents to permit a
little public business to be transacted.
"Just to fool the people." he added,
amid laughter. *,Â«--.,_
The amendment was lostâ 77 to 128. The
bill was then passed without division.
At 3:55 p. m. the Howe adjourned.

The Catholic church, following the teach
ings of the Gospel and of the Kplstles of
St. Paul, proclaims woman to be the peer
of man. "Ye are all," says St. Paul, "the
children of God by faith which is in
Christ Jesus. There is neither Jew nor
Greek, neither slave nor freeman, there
Is neither male nor female." The nwaninr
of the apostle is this: That In the dis
tribution of his gifts God makes no dis

or sex. As man and 'woman are made of
the same clay and have the same origin,
destined for the same inheritance, no they

A COMMITTEE of the State Legislature is now on its way to Los Angeles to pay to
Stephen Mi White a tribute that is without precedent or parallel in this State and prob
ably in the United States. After the Legislature had elected Thomas R. Bard a Senator of
the United States and while it still sat in joint convention it adopted a series of resolutions thank
ing Stephen M. White, in the name of a grateful people, for the distinguished services which he
had rendered to California and to the nation as a Senator of the United States. These resolu
tions, so highly eulogistic of the man whom Senator Bard succeeded, were adopted without a
dissenting vote and the people of California and of the nation were made aware of the unique
spectacle of the leading men of one political party praising and honoring a distinguished mem
ber of another party. The Republicans of California had risen superior to party prejudices and
as citizens sought to honor one whose services in public life had merited the good will and com
mendation of the people he had represented and of the State he had dignified. The spectacle is
without parallel and tells its own story of the worth of him in whose behalf it was prepared.
A SECRETARY OF MINES.
UJ HEN the Bureau of Agriculture was advanced
/ to a Cabinet department it was evident that the
other great American interest, mining, was
destined to receive like attention. This result seems
now in sight. The House Committee on Mines and
Mining has reported a bill to organise the Depart
ir.em of Mining, with a Secretary who shall be a
ir.ernber of the Cabinet. The Geological Survey will
be transferred from the Interior to the new depart
ment, and it will have charge of everything relating
to minerals, metals and mining. It will include
milhia its jurisdiction oil, gas, coal, stone, gold, sel
ver, copper, iron and all economic and precious metals
2nd minerals that are procured, mined or quarried
from the ground. The administration of mining laws
â¢will be with the new Secretary, and the department
vill be the source of the latest and best information
i:pon mining subjects. It will promote the progress
of mining methods, mechanical and chemical, and will
naturally become a means of arbitration of all issues
that arise in mining, whether they occur in conten
tion over mining ground or between owners and
operatives. The field covered by the new department
will embrace the whole country, from Alaska to the
darble and granite quarries of Maine.
The position of Secretary will be dignified and re
sponsible. We speak in the interest of the great in
dustry to be served when we say that the Secretary
of Mines, when the department is created, should b:
chosen from the mining States of the Pacific Coast,
lie should be a man with a practical knowledge of
jr.ining and of mining and land ls.w, and should have
enough grasp of chemistry and engineering to pro
tect himself in dealing with those adjuncts of mining.
Â£ uch a man can be found in California or others of
the Pacific Stales, and should be chosen to inaugur
ate the new department and map out its wide juris

diction.
In the United States is the greatest variety of useful
fend precious minerals and metals known in the world.
Their combined value amounts to trillions of dollars.
It is incalculable, inestimable. In the mining of our
precious metals there has been much waste. Through
teck of metallurgical knowledge a high percentage of
Ell the gold and silver heretofore mined has been cast
Eside as waste. As chemistry has progressively in
vaded the field of mining this profligacy has grown
less. We may expect such a scientific 'impulse from
a Mining Department that very soon miners will be
getting more gold and silver out of the waste dumps
of old mines than was originally taken out of the
mines and saved by their owners. The same is true
of many copper mines, where great waste is going
on through supposed impossibility to smelt or com
bine out of ores a close approximation" of their as
say value. In California is an opportunity to locate
the world's metallurgical center. That center is now
in Swansea, in Wales, and immense quantities of re
bellious but very rich ores are shipped from here
there, yielding profitable returns after paying 8000
m : les transportation and the cost of reduction.
There is no sorcery at Swansea. The processes there
practiced are the result of science and experience.
Let the same opportunity be given here and the
metallurgical knowledge will be found to take ad
vantage of it. The Mining Department should be at
tentive to this, among the many scientific and prac
tical matters that will be committed to it, and its
brad should be found in this Pacific mining region,
Â¦where already science is in constant use and there is
an accumulation of experience not found elsewhere.
A BAD SOCIAL CUSTOM.
CHICAGO has been mourning the visit to that
city of a clever rascal, who managed to get in
troductions to the best clubs, made love to
several girls, became engaged to two, borrowed
money right and left, picked pockets at swell recep
tions, robbed a number of houses, and finally de
parted in peace to pastures new.
The incident is not unfamiliar to American social
history. There is not a city of importance in the
United States and hardly a town where any consider
able number of wealthy people live that has not
within a comparatively few years been made the
victim of some such confidence operator. In San
Francisco we have had many, more than our share,
perhaps, and some of them have been of such recent
occurrence that the talk of them is still heard occa
sionally in clubs and boudoirs. It is clear there is
something wrong with the social customs of a coun
try where such scamps can ply their trade so success
fully and so frequently, and it is time those who are
responsible for our customs should begin to reform
them.
A statement recently made by an Englishman visit
ing this country throws some light upon the means
by which the rascals get admission to society. The
Englishman was not discussing that subject at all,
but his words are pertinent to it. He is quoted by
the New Orleans Times-Democrat as saying: "It
took me some time to grasp the American point of
view in regard to letters of introduction. When we
give a man a letter of introduction at home we con
sider that we are vouching for him socially, finan
cially, and every other way; so, needless to say, it is
never done except among relatives or the closest
friends. Here you don't seem to take the thing so
By way of illustrating American carelessness in
such matters the Englishman gave his own expe
rience. In Washington Â¦he was introduced casually
to a real estate dealer, and. having mentioned that he
was going to Nashville, the Washington man said:
"I'll give you a line to an old chum of mine there.
By the way, I did not catch your name exactly.
What is it?" The Englishman then went on to give
the sequel: "The idea of a stranger giving me a let
ter of introduction to an intimate friend when he
didn't even know my name struck me as very strange
r.nd amusing. However, I. took it with thanks, and
later found the Nashville man a very charming fel
low. When I left he insisted on giving me a note to
a friend in Memphis, who proved equally charming,
and who in turn supplied me with an introduction to
a prominent clubman here in New Orleans. The last
letter I haven't presented, and don't intend to, be
cause it contains a glaring, although inadvertent, mis
statement in referring to me as an old and cherished
friend of the gqod-natured gentlemen of Nashville
and Washington. The process, as you see, has built
me up an entirely fictitious character, and 'pon my
word I can't understand why such friendliness isn't
continually and outrageously abused by impostors."
As a matter of fact the custom is abused by im
postors, and it i? probable that many of the successful
society swindlers that operate in our cities obtain ad
missions to clubs through just this process of a chain
of letters of introduction given without thought.
American society has now become so rich that it at
tracts rascals of every kind, and, despite our liking
for the old-time freedom and hospitality of American
manners, we shall have in sheer self-defense to guard
ourselves with something of European reserve and
caution in the matter of introductions.
Clark of Montana will probably be barred from the
Senate, but he has the consolation of knowing he had
a' sensational run for. his money.

>^ In pagan countries, before the
Christian era, the woman had no
rights which . the husband waj

treated rather as the slave of man than as

"the hewer of wood and the drawer of
water." In a recent official report to our
Government on "Irrigation In India," by
Robert M. Wilson, we find that the work
of draining and canal building in that
country is chiefly relegated to women,
who receive for their labor 4 cents a day.
But let us look at woman In our own
country and In the light of American civ
ilization. What is the condition of woman
among us as soon as she closes her eyes
to the light of the gospel? She is not, in
deed, here, as In India, a beast of bur
den, but Is she not too often the victim
of pernicious principles and of moral deg
radation?
I regard woman's rights women and
society leaders In the higher walks of life
as the worst enemies of the femalÂ© sex.
They rob woman of all that Is amiable
and gentle, tender and attractive: they
rob her of her innate grace of character
and give her nothing in return but mascu
line boldness and brazen effrontery. They
are habitually preaching about woman's
rights and prerogatives and have not a
word to say about her duties and respon
sibilities. They withdraw her from those
sacred obligations which properly belong
to her sex and fill her with ambition to
usurp positions for which neither God
nor nature ever intended her. Under
the influence of such teachers we v find

TEXT OF CARDINAL GIBBONS' FAMOUS SERMON
THE FAMINE IN INDIA.
A RECENT dispatch from the Viceroy to the
Secretary of State for India says: "Good rain
has fallen again throughout Northwestern
Provinces and Oudh and Punjab. Sowings re
commenced in Punjab, but more rain is needed there.
Situation is not improved anywhere else, and distress
is increasing in Bombay, Central. Provinces and Raj
putana. Number of persons in receipt of relief:
Bombay, 805,000; Punjab, 147,000; Central Provinces,
1,491,000; Berar, 260,000; Ajmer-Merwara, 109,000;
Rajputana States, 232,000; Central India States, 120,
000; Bombay Native States, 331,000; Baroda, 63,000;
Northwestern Provinces, 4000; Punjab Native States,
iooc. Total, 3.563,000." ; ;; ;
This dispatch, being official, cannot be regarded as
an exaggerated statement. The Viceroy of India is
not likely to send out alarming statements in this
crisis of his country and his party. It is more prob
able he has underrated than overrated the distress
that threatens that portion of the British empire.
We have, therefore, confirmation that at a time when
the British Government is straining every resource to
preserve the empire in South Africa, it is confronted
bj' a calamity in India which, from its nature and its
extent, may be truly called appalling.
Over 3,500,000 people are already in receipt of gov
ernmental relief, and still there is no sign of an end
to the famine. Meantime, too, the Russians are
pushing their aggressions across Asia toward that
very India where the pangs of famine are breeding
the bitterest discontents against the Government and
rendering, the distressed people desperate enough to
hail any kind of change of government.
In the course of their imperial career the British peo
ple have had many a hard condition to face. They had
once to confront their American colonies in revolt
and at the same time war with France, Spain and Hol
land. In the beginning of this century they had once
to go up against a coalition of nearly all Europe, with
Napoleon at its head. It is doubtful, however, if even
the worst and hardest of those bygone trials put a
severer strain upon the empire than that which it is
now undergoing. Moreover, in the old days of stress
and strain Great Britain had great men to guide her
counsels and command her fleets and her armies; but
now she is weak everywhere, while her foes grow
strong around her. It is not merely that the Cabinet
is composed of mediocre men, with the exception of
Salisbury, who is too old to give much service, but
there is no strong man in either party in Parliament
to assume control if a reorganization of the Ministry
should be undertaken. In the field it is not much
better. Buller has failed, and Roberts and Kitchener
have yet to show what they can do against a well
armed and resolute army of white men fighting for
their country. x
Under such circumstances the famine in India may
affect the politics of the world. It is a factor in their
problems the most reckless of British statesmen dare
not overlook. Relief must be furnished' to the
starving people, and that on a scale of unparalleled
magnitude. The whole famine districts must be care
fully and vigilantly garrisoned. Not a single, soldier
can be taken from India now to urge on the war
against the Boers, and to the vast expenditures caused
by the war on hand there must be added further sums
to prevent the outbreak of another.
CIVIL SERVICE AND PENSIONS.
SEVERAL times the appropriation for the
Civil Service Commission has been stricken out
by the House, in committee of the whole,
where there is no rollcall, and restored in the House,
where there is a rollcall and a record. It would be
far better for the welfare of the service if members
who oppose it on principle would have the courage
of their convictions and vote in the House as they
do in committee. Then there would be furnished a
test of public sentiment on the question, which would
finally fix the national policy, one way or the other.
There is unanimous agreement that our upright
and creditable administration of the new possessions
in the tropics must depend entirely upon a straight
and strict adherence to the civil service rules. Look
ing to the example of England's colonial administra
tion, the claim is made and proved by Englishmen
that without the merit system no success at all could
have been achieved in administering conquests as
crown colonies. Our own imperialists and members
of the several commissions which have considered
the problems of government in Porto Rico, Hawaii
and the Philippines agree that there must be an ex
tension to those governments of the strictest civil
service rules.
Many have argued, also, that the civil service law
enforced there will react favorably upon our domes
tic administration, and will strengthen the system at
home.
As to its results so far attained in our home Gov
ernment, we are persuaded that they amply justify the
reform. Many men in public life who have had ex
perience with both prefer the reform to the spoils
system, and feel that their public duties are easier to
themselves and more beneficial to the country when
they are relieved of the vexation and strife connected
with the dispensing of patronage.
From its inauguration the merit system has been
compelled to run the gauntlet of opposition, mis
icpresentation and attack. The powerful influence
of local politicians has" been against it, for reasons
that are not in accord with the welfare of the Gov
ernment. The system itself has suffered from a too
pedantic treatment by the commission which enforces
it. Still, with all these drawbacks, it stands justified
before the country.
It is to be regretted that it is again attacked. In
the latest assault the pension question was impinged
upon it, and the heated debate in committee of the
whole was made torrid by the combination of fuel.
No one questions the need of a revision of our mili
tary pension system. The only good thing to be sa,id of
the features that need reform and correction is that
they make it so costly that the country will think
twice before making war. We do not say that a re
adjustment would at present lessen the cost of pen
sions, but that it would place the money where it
will do more good than at present. The practically
helpless and deserving, who by reason of physical im
pairment must have help, would get nearer the meas
ure of their needs, while those who have the physical
capacity for self-support, and as a fact do support
themselves independently of their pensions, would
get less than they take now. The latter class are the
longest survivors: the former, by reason of their phy
sical weakness, have a shorter expectation of life.
Therefore by this readjustment the heavier payments
will cease the soonest, and the appropriation will an
nually decrease, to the relief of the taxpayers. If
Congress would stand by the civil service, or test
public opinion by abolishing it, and enter upon a
courageous and sympathetic revision and readjust
ment of the pension list, it would be doing something
positive. in each case, and the country could readily
make up its mind to an affirmative policy. Mere ex
change of epithet accomplishes nothing.
THE SOUTH AFRICAN CAMPAIGN
UP to this time the tactics of General Joubert
have been as novel and confusing to the Brit
ish military authorities as were Bonaparte's to
the Austrians. The Boers rely not only on expert
gunnery, but upon a knowledge of the country that
facilitates rapid movement and sudden concentration.
In a military sense it is probable that the movements
of French open the serious phase of the war. The
Boers have avoided an encounter that might have
greatly weakened them, and seem to be occupied with
another tactical plan in which they propose to select
their own ground for a general engagement. French's
movements are still on British territory, and nothing
can be positively known of their value until he gets
on Boer ground. England has received encourage
ment of which she stood in great need, and the
waning enthusiasm of her people will feel the im
pulse. There is no sign 'of abatement in the grim de
termination of the Boers, and no doubt the world is
about to witness one of the most terrible struggles of
tht> rmtnrv
The consequences are more serious than those in
volved in the campaigns of Marlborough or Welling
ton. England was then in a stage of her development
at which defeat as leader of the coalitions against
Louis XIV and Bonaparte would not have seriously
affected her. Now the case is different. She stands
more alone in the world and with wider borders to
defend and more to suffer by loss of military pres
tige.
Her empire is cast in the balance against the inde
pendence of the two small republics. They may lose
with but little present effect upon the rest of the
world. Only a principle will suffer, and the results of
its overthrow will work out but slowly among civil
institutions.
With England it is far different. The maintenance
of her material power has under her policy become
just such a necessity as it was with every preceding
Lord Rosebery, who is a leader of those who
opposed the war, who were averse to risking so much
for so small a gain, takes the thoughtful and sober
view of it, and has uttered the warning of danger to
come.
He evidently sees that England has accumulated
responsibilities more rapidly than she has gathered
resources to meet them. The least appearance of
trouble in India or Egypt will call for an increase in
her resources of defense, and he confesses that he
does not know where those resources may be found.
His discussion of her situation is a shadow upon the
exultation which goes with her first successful mili
tary exploit in South Africa.
Mr. Balfour's attempts to minimize the effect of
Rosebery's warning rather intensified its effect. He
held Rosebcry up in unfavorable contrast to another
opponent. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who had
just opposed conscription as an undignified way of
"increasing the strength which Great Britain mort
gaged in her endeavor to be before her neighbors in
every part of the world." Notwithstanding his denial
of any intention to resort to conscription, Mr. Bal
fcur left matters in the dark by saying that he waited
for Sir Henry to suggest a method of meeting the,
heavy military responsibilities of the country.

MISS VAN BUREN
AS SANS GENE
On Friday afternoon Miss Mary Van
Buren played the name part In Sardoa's
"Madame Sans Gene." She did well. The
part is In all sorts of ways more trying
than anything she has yet attempted here
and her playing of It may be regarded as
a test of her fitness for a life work on
the stage. So regarded there is the same
evidence of promise In her acting that
appeared In most of her minor efforts,
but there is the same uncertain grasp,
the same unease â In fine, the same want
of finish.
Beneath the beauty that Is only skin
deep there Is an actress whose enthu
siasm Is bound to take her somewhere If
It be but guided aright. There Is a dan
ger, however, of certain mannerisms be
coming chronic with Miss Van Buren,
which, as they have not the forgivable
charm of Ada Rehan's affectations, may
seriously Impede her ascent to the upper
strata of stagedom. I refer particularly
to her metronomic accent, that way she
haa of throwing out every fifth word
with an abrupt Jerk of the head. It is not
only destructive of natural emphasis (a
rather more Important matter than most
actors and actresses seem to think), but
It is tiresome and labels every character
Mls3 Van Buren assumes with her full
name in large type.
As the Impetuous Sans Gene she acted
with charm and an absolute Infectious
art that won her the house; but I hasten
to add this was in the flrst act only. In
the prologue she did not have a sincere
touch, and although she was skillful in
the last two acts she fell short of a spell
ing spontaneity. ,
I do not know for how much of. thÂ©
modern slang and colloquialisms with
which the lines are loaded Mr. Metzler
Is responsible, nor how much may b*
charged up to Mr. Frawley and Miss Van
Buren herself, but It Is In as bad taste as
it Is unnecessary, and I think it may be
safely stated that M. Sardou, charlatan
that he Is. did not put any of the present
argot of the boulevard In the mouth. oÂ£

Mr. Frawley did not play Svengall on

Strong Effort Was Loyally Made In

The business house founded by J. J.
O'Brien finally closed its doors at 6 o'clock
last night. The stock of goods has been
sold to Hale Brothers. Reluctantly the
old employes of the late J. J. O'Brien, who
had served faithfully, realized that the en

years ago the business of the house
amounted to over $1,000,000 per annum.

"After a long and trying struggle the
old establishment Is at last compelled,
owing to lack of necessary capital, to wind
up its affairÃ and retire from the field In
which for over thirty years it has held so
prominent a place.
"Ten months ago I was invited to as
sume charge of the business, which at the
time was in a very precarious condition.
Several of the leading employes, \*ith
long experience in its workings and know
ing Its extraordinary hold upon the good
will of the public, at once associated tnem.
selves as stockholders with Mrs. J. J.
O'Brien, widow of the founder of the
house, and myself. Although we con
trolled only a small amount of capital, wo
felt that it would not be impossible lor
us to successfully overcome the difficulties
of the situation. To this end we worked
hard, and, 1 may add, our motives were
not altogether mercenary.
"Hard work, however, and the closest
attention to details will not make up now
a-days for the lack of gold coin in the
running of a concern of this magnitude.
Buying goods on credit and selling them
in competition with rival houses that pur
chase for cash and take all discounts is,
as we well know, an unprofitable under
taking. An eminent authority on commer
cial affairs has strongly condemned what
he terms the 'popular but atrocious maxim
that there is no friendship in business,'
and I fully agree with his view. In our
efforts toward rehabilitating the old es
tablishment of J. J. O'Brien & Co. we re
ceived many proofs of friendship and
rood-will, both on the part of its patrons
and Its creditors, for which we are duly
and sincerely grateful."
In Mr. Bannerman's words â "lack of
grold coin"â the story of llnal failure is
told. J. J. O'Brien started In business in
San Francisco on Third street in 1869.
Later he removed to the Arcade, on Mar
ket street. From the Arcade he went to
the Murphy building, where the business
has finally been wound up. Mr. O'Brien's
brother James was associated with him
for a part of the time. After J. J.
O'Brien's sudden death in Highland
Springe, to which place he had gone to
hunt, the business of the house was upset.
Then It was put by the creditors Into the
hands of Judge Robert J. Tobln. Adam
Grant, Jeremiah Mahony and Dr. C. F.
Buckley. They held the business one year,
during which they paid off over $200,000 of
Indebtedness. In 1593 the business was in
corporated, with James O'Brien, brother
of J. J. O'Brien, as president of the cor
poration. In April, 1899, James O'Brien
retired and Thomas R. Bannerman be
came a stockholder and also president and
manager of the business.
Mr. Bannerman took hold for the solo
purpose of saving what he could for the
widow of J. J. O'Brien. Although he de
clined to answer the question, when he
was asked, It Is a fact well known to those
who were associated with him that he
worked without pay or compensation of
any financial sort. He brought to the
great task that he voluntarily, assumed
much business experience as cashier of
O'Connor & Moffatt, -as executor of i the
will of Mrs. Bryan O'Connor and as a
banker. J. J. O'Brien was his friend.
The memory of that caused him to give
his services. Nothing could finally avert
tho failure that cam*. The best thins to

Frank Sherman Meets an Unexpected Nemesis in a Park Policeman.
FRANK SHERMAN, the well-known business man,
society favorite and lover of horse flesh, has been
lassoed â and that by a park policeman. While
Mr. Sherman's favorite pastime Is speeding behind
some of bis blooded stock, he occasionally, as a matter of
variety, takes to the bike. His reputation of being an ex
pert horseman also applies to his pedaling accomplish
ments. Mr. Sherman has been living easy until the new
regime In charge of the park decided that all rules apply
ing to speed should be strictly enforced. Mr. Sherman
could not drive to the beach at his wonted pace, but he
thought that coasting on a bike at a 2:40 gait "wouldn't
mean no harm." Even this, he was told, was against the
rules, and great was his grief thereat.
"I can't ride the thing fast up bill," he explained to his
friends, "and they won't let me ride It fast going down
hill, but you watch me fool them."
His friends -watched, but they took a park policeman
into the eecret, and that is how Mr. Sherman happened to
be lassoed. He pushed his wheel before him up one of
the steepest grades In the park. Great beads of perspira
tion dripped from his brow, and the only thing that gave
him courage to continue to the top was the thought of the
long and speedy coast he was going to enjoy on the other
elde.
At the summit he mounted his bike and away he went.
He had gained elegant headway and Mis countenance was
beaming with satisfaction when the man with the lariat
came on his galloping steed behind him. The long rope
circled around his head and then went straight for Sher
man. The loop went around the merchant's waist. Tho
other end was attached to the pummel of the policeman's
saddle. The horse stopped and so did Sherman, but the
bike went on down the hill. Being in his bicycle togsâ
which are usually built without pocketsâ Sherman was
shy of funds and was led away to the station-house,
where his friends went to his rescue and balled him out.
The experience cost him many small bottles when he
appeared down town in his everyday clothes.

Secretary Kane of the Society for the
Suppression of Vice Declares He
? ; Is Guilty of Questionable
Practices.
A. H. Geffeney, Immigration Inspector
and Japanese interpreter with the Immi
gration Bureau at this port, is again in
trouble with the Federal authorities, and,
as upon two previous occasions, he is
charged with the extortion of money from
Japanese landlords of questionable re
sorts. Frank J. Kane, secretary of the
Society for the Suppression of Vice, ap
pears as tho accuser, and tho charges and
Information recently filed by him with
Hart H. North, the Immigration Commis
sioner, were by the latter yÂ«sterday for
warded to Washington.
The evidence presented consists of an
apparently compromising letter written
by Geffeney and the statements of three
Japanese, who were cognizant of the facts
in the case.
On January 27 Secretary Kane raided
the house of a Japanese named Kataro
Ito at 7 Spatford alley for the purpose of
rescuing two 14-year-old Japanese girls,
who were confined there for Immoral pur
poses. He was accompanied by Special
Othcer Coleman and an Interpreter named
Miyakawa, and while searching the rooms
found on a table a letter addressed to C.
Akabau. The envelope bore the stamp of
tho Immigration Bureau, and Kane at
once demanded of Ito information as to
Its contents. Ito professed Ignorance, and
Kane opened the communication In the
presence of his men and read It. It was
signed by Geffeney and reads as follows:
Office of the United Commissioner of Imml-
gratlon. Port of Ban Francisco, Cal., Sept.
7, 1899.
Dear Mr. Akabauâ l was very much surprised
at the telephone message I received from Han
nah. I want to cay that I must have what I
asked for by 12 o'clock Friday. II I do not I
will make serious trouble for Mr. Ito. I shall
expect to see you by 12 o clock. I must have
It. If I do not I will make it very disagreeable
for them. A. H. OEFFENEY.
After reading It Kane again demanded
an explanation of Ito, who still disclaimed
any knowledge of it. In fact, no one in
Ito's establishment would admit ever hav
ing seen It. Kane thereupon took it to
the residence of Akabau at 809 Stockton
street, where he found Akabau's daughter
Hannah, a bright Japanese girl, who acts
as. her father's interpreter. ICane showed
her the letter and she at once called in her
father and advised him to tell the story
of his connection with Geffeney.
After some further pressure Akabau
said that on or about the sth of September
he met Geffeney, who told him that he
was about to take a vacation and that he
needed money. He asked him. to go to
Ito and demand of him the sum of $15 as
a contribution toward the expenses of the
trip. Akabau demurred, but Gefiteney In
sisted, and the Jap finally consented.
Upon reaching home and talking it over
with his daughter, however, ho changed
his mind and sent the girl to a telephone
office to tell Geffeney that he would not
carry the message. The next day, accord-
Ing to Akabau, he received the letter
which Kane discovered In the house of
Ito, and upon learning Its contents at once
delivered It to Ito. There, he claimed, his
connection with the matter ended. He did
not know whether Ito complied with Gef
feney's demand or not.
Kane at once reduced Akabau's state
ment to writing and the Jap and his
daughter signed It, with Miyakawa, the in
terpreter, and Officer Coleman as wit
nesses. On February 9he handed his evi
dence to Commissioner North, who after
an Investigation of bis own forwarded It
to Washington.
Geffenoy has twice before bten in sim
ilar trouble, but each time has been
cleared after a searching- investigation.
His friends claim that this, like the other
cases, Is one of spite work on the part of
his Japanese enemies, and they are con
fident that he will be promptly \indicated.

THE ASSEMBLYMAN'S JOB.
J&an From the Thirty-Ninth Handled
the Mayor's Fight in Sacramento
and Is Rewarded With a
Broken Promise.
Meyer Phelan Is etlll enraged In the
Fcntle art of making enemies. Nothing
Catmted at the list he set up by his re
cent manipulation of the Police Depart
ment, he is now putting In his Idle hours
In sowing dissension In the ranks of the
Ban Francisco Democratic delegation to
the State Legislature. As In the flrst case,
fc-.s latest attempts at political effacement
are meeting with pronounced success, and.
Â«Jso as in the first case, the enemies he
Is creating an; all of his own party and
ere led by no less a personage than Justus
wardell. Democratic Assemblyman from
the Thirty-ninth Assembly District.
Since the Mayor first dawned as a guirt
ir.g star in the political firmament he has
reiied larrely upon Wardell to accomplish
for him many email things necessary to
the success of a. large campaign, aiid
Warden has generally succeeded In land-
Ing the goods, not so much because of his
political ability as his consummate nerve.
Vp to the last extraordinary session of
the Legislature he had never demanded
of the executive anything in the way of
reward, notwithstanding that his political
career and its attendant expense had
practically sold him out of the modest
printing business in which he was en
paged. When the late session opened,
however, Wardell came to the front. He
announced that he was tired of working
for nothing more than an occasional meal
ticket, that if there was to be anything
doinp he would do it, but that a "subse-
Q'Jt-nt salary of not less than $173 per
month would be his price.
Wardeil proved to be a capable guesser.
for a day or so later he was summoned
into the Presence by Charlie Fay and dur
ing the course of an otherwise platitudin
ous conversation his very good friend, the
Mayor, confidentially informed him that
he desired the complimentary Democratic
vote for Senator when the balloting for
that oflice should come off. Phelan etart
cd to hand out his usual basket of gold
bricks, but Wardell. prown wise by pre
vious similar experiences, called him
down, and before he Kot through both had
entered into a Stipulation as to that $175
jol.. In fact. IT is said that the Mayor
expressed surprise that the Assemblyman
from the Thirty-ninth should ask no
irrc-ator reward.
Up in Bacramento when the fi&ht came
off Wardeil's advocacy of Phelan was
nothing ioss than spectacular. He nad no
patronage to offT in return for compli
mentary votes, but he was flush with is
enrnt.ct'S of the continued distinguished
consideration of the city's chief executive,
and lir.ally made it go. as when it came
to a showdown all of the Assembly save
Jack Crowly of San Francisco lined up
with h:m ar.d . threw their votes to Phe
lan.
It didn't po. howÂ»vor, when he returned

NOT CLEAR ENOUGHâ D. P., City.
The query in regard to over money in a

and the amounts named are so badly
mixed that it is impossible to furnish an
answer.
ON A PROSPECTING TOUR-C. T..
City. If you desire to take a trip this side
of the Rockies with a view to prospecting:
for gold call at or communicate with the
State Mining Bureau, in the ferry build

THE TARIFFâ A. S., City. This de
partment has not the space to devote to
"a synoposis of the tariff question since
ISS2." Would suggest that you visit the
system of State highways extending from
Redding, in Shasta County, at the head of
the Sacramento Valley, to Bakersflolil,
Kern County, at the head of the San Joa
quin Valley, which, the report stated,
could be constructed easiest and cheapest:
and which, for the least expenditure of
money, could furnish an object lesson In
good roads to the greatest number of pec
pie.
The committee also recommended that
the subject of good roads be -made a po
litical issue. The bonding system was
recommended as the Â¦ most economical
method, and in a special clause the inac
tion of the Legislature In the matter of
good roads was regretted. It was recom
mended that a copy of the resolutions be
recommended to the Sacramento. Valley
Development Association, with the re
quest that it co-operate with the San Joa
quin Valley Association by the appoint
ment of a committee of five to work in
conjunction with a like committee from
the latter association, to report at the
next quarterly meeting. It Is expected
that the report will be adopted.
The report of President Buell was a
review of the work of organizing the
association, and the subsequent work of
the executive committee. It contained no
recommendations.
The evening session was taken up with
a discussion of the proposition to bond
the State for the improvement of roads.
A resolution was passed urging the Cali
fornia representatives in Congress to sup
port the Hepburn-Morgan bill for the
construction, fortification and control of
the Nicaragua canal. There was further
discussion on the methods to be pursued
in advertising the valley, and other mat
ters of interest were considered. It was
decided to" hold the next meeting of the
association in Bakersfleld on May 26. An
elaborate banquet was spread in the Yo
semite Hotel and several toasts were elo
quently responded to.

ABOUT A PATENTâ D. A. P.. Canyon,
Cal. If you desire to obtain a patent for
a valuable invention and do not know
anything about the mode of procedure,
the safest thing to do Is to consult a
reliable agent who will treat your com
munications confidentially and sayÂ« you
a great deal of trouble and preserve your
right, which you might Jeopardize If you
attempted to try to secure a patent on
your own account. There are a number
of pamphlets that give a synopsis of the
mode cf procedure, but as a rule they
tend more to confuse than to enlighten.
If the correspondent will send a self-ad
dressed and stamped envelope, such a
synopsis will be forwarded.
COUSINSâ J. R. N*.. Stanford. Mont.
The children of brothers and sisters are
called cousins, cousins german, first ecu
sins or full cousins. Often, however, the
term second cousin in loosely applied to
the son or a daughter of a cou3in ger
man, more properly called a first cousin,
once removed. A first cousin onca re
moved is the child's first cousin, a first
cousin twice removed is the grandchild of
one's first cousin: a second cousin onca
removed is the child of one' 3 second
cousin. A first cousin once removed is
sometimes called a second cousin, fol
lowed by a third, fourth, etc. The rela
tion of an individual to his father's
cousin is that of first cousin, once re
moved, or second cousin, and his relation
to his father's cousin's child la that of
first cousin, twice removed, or third
cousin. From thi3 you can flgrur* out ths
relationship of cousins down to thÂ« forty
third branchâ that Is, if you hayÂ» thÂ«
time and patience.
DAMP WALLSâ C. I*. C!ay. ThÂ» fol
lowing cement is used on walls that arÂ»
affected by dampness, and it is said that,
while It keeps out dampness. It possesses
the advantage of oil paint without Its
disadvantage of smell: "A coat of ox
ide of zinc, mixed with size mads up
like a wash, is first laid on the plastered
wall or ceiling, and after that a coat of
chloride of einc applied; prepared In th*
same manner as the first wash. The* ox
ide and chloride effect an immediate com
bination and form a kind of cement
smooth and polished as glass."
Another method as a protection against
damp wall is the following:: "Take Sl.^S 1 .^
pounds of mottled soap and dissolve in,
one gallon of water. This compound ia
to be laid on the wall steadily and care
fully with a large fiat brush, so as not ta
form a froth or lather on the surface; thÂ«
wash to remain twenty-four hours In or
der to dry. Then mix half a pound cf
alum with four gallons of water, and ap
ply in the same manner over the coating
of soap. This must be done In dry weath
er." In a particular case the* dampness
may arise from a very Blight leak in onÂ«
of the water pipes. In that case you would
have to call in the services of a plumber.

The Original Speech.
The original speech, the true primeval
tongue of man, was quite unlike any
language wo have ever, heard; yet we
have all talked It. and all Its elements
are present In the tongues of to-day. The
primeval language was a vowel language
altogether; it had no consonants, or con
tracts, as we ought to call them, at all.
Its words consisted of vowel sounds fol
lowing each other repeated or variedâ
of words like aeaea, aoao, aia, auau,
aeota, iaua, oioi, ouou, uaua, ueue, all of
which 1 may say. In passing are taken
from a language in use to-day. The sen
tences were Intermittent streams .of
vowels, each stream held on so long as
the speaker's breath allowed or whim dic
tated. When all literature was recited,
the . same consideration, the capacity of
the lunss, determined the length of the
bardic lines; so we have our shlokas, our
hexameters, our Alexandrines anu so
forth, each a lungful of verse; In the
primeval tongue It was likewise, but the
sentences were vowels only. â¢
There are about ten or a dozen pure
vowels to go upon, and vowel words may
run up to five syllables, so we have a very
considerable fund to draw on for our
vowel streams. And these streams of vow
el Â¦ speech correspond to and . , expressed
streams of emotion or feeling rather than
descriptions of concrete objects. For. we
hardly realize how terribly overladen with
material trifles our life is to-day, and,
therefore, what great demands we make
on language for concrete words. But our
exclamations, each of . which Indicates- a
single emotion, tend to remain pure vowel
sounds even at the present day.â The Con

"I hold Colonel Bryan really responsible for the law. If he had not artfully captured the nomination
four years ago with his carefully prepared speech either Bland, Teller or Stevenson would probably have been
nominated and elected. Bryan defeated himself and his party by his volubility, and the party's defeat then
permits a gold standard law now. In all time only one man has been endowed with sufficient power to de
feat the enemy with a jawbone."

SACRAMENTO, Feb. I".â Judge Hughes
granted a divorce this morning to Jessie
Kdglr.gton from Thomas Edgington,
marking the culmination "of a marriage
nearly two years agu as the result of a
Joke and a dare. The Kdgingtons have
r;evrr lived together since their marriage,
they had never kept company with one
another previous to their marriage and
Edgington has never done anything to
ward supporting his wife.
Mrs. Edgington was Jessie Dashlell and
lives in Sacramento. Edgington lives in
Elk Grove. On August 1. 1898, Miss Dash-
It-:!, who was visiting in Elk Grove, at
tended a party there. Edgington was also
present. Some reference had been made
to a marriage and one of the company re
marked to Edglngion that he would be the
next to Join the benedicts. He replied
that there was little danger of that, as he
had tried for some time to convince the
Elk Grove girls that he would make a
good husband, but they were not of his
way of thinking, Dashiell said he
need not remain single on that account,
8"= she would marry iiim. Edgington said
fhe must be Joking, but she replied that
Fhe was in earnest and dared him to
marry her th^n and there.
Edgir.gton said no young lady from Sac
ramento could make him take a dare and
he came at once to this city and procured
a license. V.'hen he returned Miss Dash
iell was inclined to back out. but Edging
ton insisted *he had dared him before the
company and must take the consequences.
Some of the company "Joshed" Miss
Pashiell on account of her desire to
weaken, and fhe finally declared she
would stand by her statement.
Tne two went to Rev. Ado'.ph Haverly
end were made husband and wife. Mrs.
Edgington came at once to Sacramento
and has seen her husband but once since.

grounds of desertion. The details did not

EL PASO, Tex., Feb. .17.â At 5 o'clock
this morning a mob of negro soldiers from
Fort Bliss attacked the city police sta
tion with the object of -releasing two of
their comrades who had been arrested
yesterday. During the fight Police Officer
Newt Stewart and one negro soldier were
killed, and it is believed- that another of
the soldiers Is wounded.
Yesterday afternoon the police locked
up a corporal from the fort for being
drunk and threatening, to chaso the police
force out of the city, and last night an
other drunken soldier was arrested. Com
rades of the prisoners took the news to
the post. A rescue party, armed with
Krag-Jorgensons, was organized, and just
before daylight a descent was made on
the city,
A few minutes before 5 o'clock two of
the soldiers, rifles in hand, entered the
police station and demanded of Officer
Stewart, the only man on duty, the sur
render of their comrades.
Stewart ordered the men out of the sta
tion and they opened fire on him. Jailer
Richard Blacker, who sleeps In a room
adjoining the station ofllce, aroused by
the shots, sprang out of bed, grabbed his
pistol and started into the office. As soon
as he appeared in the. doorway one of the
soldiers lired at him.
Blacker dropped to his knees and, at his
first shot, one of the negroes staggered
and ran out, closely followed by his com
panion, and the entire squad left on a
run. About twenty shots were fired In all.
Stewart was shot twice through the lungs
and died at 7 o'clock.
A trail of blood leading from the station
was followed and half a block away the
dead body of a negro, shot through the
breast, was found. The dead man still
clutched his gun In his hands. A second
rifle and traces of blood were also found,
which indicated that another of the ne
groes was wounded.
Officers Blacker and Scott pursued the
fleeing soldiers, but were unable to make
' The troops stationed at Fort Bliss be
long to Company E, Twenty-fifth Infan
try. Posses are. out looking for the ma
rauders, though, at the post It Is claimed
that the only missing soldiers are the
dead man and the two prisoners In the
police station.
The police have learned from the two
prisoners the name of one of the soldiers
who did the shooting in the station office,
and Sheriff Boone and Chief of Police
Lochart have demanded the surrender of
the man from the commandant of the
post. The latter has given assurance that
he will lend all possible assistance in
bringing- the guilty men to justice, and it
is believed that there will be no further
clash. The entire police force, however,
has been mounted and armed with Win
chesters, to be in readiness for any emer
gency. The feeling here against the sol
diers is very bitter,' and many citizens
have offered their services to the civil
authorities.

NEW YORK. Feh. 17.-\Vith all the fury
of a blizzard, the first real snowstorm of
the winter descended upon New York to
day. A wind out of the northwest blow
ing from twenty-five to thirty miles an
hour Mew the snow about In thick, blind
ing clouds. About ten Inches had fallen
by midnight.
Great was th* menace to shipping be
cause of the blinding storm and the in
shore wind. . The last ship to arrive in
this port to-day was the C.-impania, which
pasrFed quarantine at 9:30 a. m. The
Amerii-aji liner St. Louis was due this
mornine. but she was not reported up to
midnight. La Touraine is due to-mor
row, but it Is not expected she will reach
port on time.
The last ship out was th<Â» Etrurla, which
left her pier at Ba. m. The Graf Walder-
Fee, which attempted to pass out. went
aground near RomT shoals at 6 p. m.
The thick snow prevented anything be
ing seen to-night from Sandy Hook and
it is not known whether the liner
floated off with the high tide. Through
out the suburbs of New York, in Long
Island and about New Jersey, everything
points to a partial blockade by the snow.

that not many days ago was sprung at a
banquet In London and brought about his
ears a thunder of applause that rattled
the chunks of ice in the punch bowl:
Mr. Choate said. that, he went into a
bookshop in the Strand a few days before
to purchase a copy of Dante's "Inferno."
It was his Intention to present the book
to' a young friend who particularly wanted
to read It. Much to Mr. Choate's chagrin
the Instant he stepped foot in the store
the word "Inferno .entirely escaped hiÂ»
roind. v â¢ 'Â¦'â¢"â¢ .
He told the salesman that he would be
back In a minute, and he walked away
down to Whithall trying to think of the
last half of the book he wanted. Of
courte it was Dante's "something." but
Dante's "what"?â that was the question.
Finally he gave up trying to recall the
full title and went back to the shop. The
clerk asked him what hÂ« sought. He
made a bold stab. "I want a copy of
Dante's 'Hell,' " he replied.
The clerk darted back to the rear of the
store. By and by he returned with empty
hands. ,"I am very Â«orry." he Â«aid. "but
we haven't got Hell, by Dante, but
we've got 'Twenty Teara in Bouth
Africa,' oy Cecil Rhodes, If that would
do." Â¦'-' . - â¢ .
"And feeling,"" concluded ? Mr. Choate,
"that that was practically the same thing,
I took the book."

KANSAS CITY, Mo.. Feb. 17.-Arthur
E. Stilwell, promoter and president of the
Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Gulf Railroad
Company, is the -moving spirit In an am
bitious xailroad scheme that was an
nounced here to-day. '.His plan contem
plates a new international railway sys
tem 1800 miles in length, stretching from
Kansas City to the Gulf of California.
The Kansas City, Mexico and Orient
Railway Company was incorporated in
Kansas City to-day with an authorized
capital of $1,000,000. The incorporators in
clude Mr. Stilwell, J. W\ Hirst of Omaha,
president of the linseed oil trust; Dr. W.
S. Woods and W. A. Rule, Kansas City
hankers; J. C. Fox and E. W. Snyder of
Leavenworth, Kans., capitalists; H. A.
Wltherbee of Detroit, Mich., Herman
Kuhn of London, Eng., and several other
capitalists of Missouri and Kansas.
Through the corporation thus formed it
Is hoped to capitalize the scheme. The
plan contemplates a railroad from Kan
sas City through Topeka and Wichita,
Kans., through El Reno, O. T., and
through Northwestern and Western
Texas, between the Santa Fe and Rock
Island lines, to a point on the Rio Grande
River about twenty miles south and east
of El Paso, thence southwest to Chihua
hua, Mexico.
At Chihuahua connection is proposed
with a line now being built to the south
west, its ultimate terminus to be Topolo
bampo. on the Gulf of California. Ot this
line 1607 miles is already constructed.
Mr. Wltherbee, the Detroit member of thÂ«
corporation formed to-day, holds the con
cessions from the Mexican Government,
under which the work is progressing.
Mr. Stilwell proposes to incorporate the
several lines into one great 6ystem. Ho
announces that it is a $27,000,000 proposi
tion, but in view of his success in pro
moting the Plttsburg and Gulf during the
panicky times of the early '90's he be
lieves ft can be done.
DETROIT. Feb. 17.â Henry A. Wither
bee of .this city, who is interested in the
projected new International railway, in
addition to holding the right of way for
the Mexican branch of the propsed sys
tem, has a concession of $10,000,000 from
the Mexican Government to aid in its
construction. The Mexican Government
also agreed to allow all materials used in

ELECTION OF OFFICERS OF THE

. ?
Nothing Definite Is Known as Yet
as to Those Who Will Be Chosen
to Command the Com
panies.
There are rumor* In National Guard
circles to the effect that the commander
In chief. Henry T. Gage, proposes to turn
down Major General John H. Dickinson
In consequence of the position he took, or
rather the position that he did not tak-j,
as to D. M. Burns in the late Senatorial
light. Burns, it is said, lays his defeat
to tne action of the major general as Sen
etor. and has asked the Governor to turn
the division commander down at the ear
liest possible moment. Those who are
close to the powers that be profess larnor
ance In regard to the matter, or If they
do know decline to say anything about It.
It is also announced that the command
er in chief has in contemplation the re
tirement of a number of the colonels on
his personal staff and the parceling out of
a like number of honorary gold bricks to
those who have done the Governor of the
State some service.
Last Friday Lieutenant Colonel Du
boce received telegraphic advice from su

Subsequently an order was issued from
brigade headquarters calling for an elec
tion for the line officers of the twelve
companies on Wednesday, February 28,
the elections for Companies C, G, V and
X to be held at the Ellis-street armory.
and the elections in the other companies
at the Pa?e-street armory. The following
named oflicers on tha brigade staff have
been detailed to preside at the elections:
Charles Jensen, major and Inspector, for
A and B; H. A. Wegener, major and
quartermaster, for D and E; J. A. Margo,
major and commissary, for C and F; H.
B. Hosmer. major and inspector rifle prac
tice, for G; J. H. Hendy. major and en
gineer officer, for H; C. J. Evans, major
and signal officer, for I; D. S. Dorn, major
and judge advocate, for X; S. L. Naph
taly. captain, A. D. C.for L; A. A. Hinks,
captain, A. D. C, for M.
I Now that the First Regiment is once
more In the service of the State, Lieu
tenant Colonel Duboce breathes freer than
he had for some time, as It had been
his ambition and that of a number of
the line officers who came back from Ma
nila with him to return the First to the
guard of the State. As announced in or
ders, xhe election for line officers will be
held on the last daj- of the month. What
changes . will take place In the several
companies is not known, and there does
not appear to be any concert of action
at this time as to what officers or men
will receive the votes of the men in the
ranks. There have been any number of
wild guesses, but they do not count, for
if any combinations are to be made in
the several companies they will be made
this week. After the line officers shall
have qualified, then will come the elec
tion for field officers. Lieutenant Colonel
Duboce has been mentioned for the posi
tion of colonel, and while he is not. In
consequence of many duties that are now
devolving upon him in an official capacity
and in civil life, an avowed candidate, he
feels that should it be the desire of the
new line officers by their votes to have
him at the head of the regiment he would
not decline. He feels that if his ser
vices in the past for the regiment and
his service in the volunteer service should
gain for him the honor of an election
he would have to accept the kindly recog
nition of his fellow officers.
Lieutenant Colonel jGeistlng announces
that many of the uniforms have been
received and that they are being sub
jested to test before acceptance. The
uniform board has also ordered chevrons
and Btripes. which are to be furnished to
companies without charging the same to
the amount allow each company. The
caps have all been received, and it is said
that they are the best ever furnished to
the guard.
Brigadier General Warfleld of the Sec
ond Brigade returned from hra Eastern
trip last evening.
Commissions have been issued to
Charles P. Lundhol, first, and J. L. N.
Kenelly second lieutenant of Company C,
Fifth Infantry, located at Petaluma.
John Magennls, a sergeant of the Fifth
Infantry, has received a silver bar in
recognition of fifteen years' service in the
guard.
THERE has been considerable â¢ actlv-;
ity In real estate circles during the
past week and a large number of
good sales were made by brokers.
The condition of the market is bet
ter than for a long time and pros
pects are good for a still further Improve

â¢
Assistant Surgeon General Pope Will
Remain Here Until His Retire
ment From the Service â To
I>istribute Medals.
Chaplain John H. Macomber, U. S. A.,
was yesterday retired from active ser
vice in the army, having reached the age
limit, and will start for the East in a
few days, accompanied by his wife. .In
the year that the chaplain has been sta
tioned at the Presidio he has accom
plished a vast amount of good, and by
his unfailing devotion to the sick and
wounded soldiers who have come under
his spiritual care he has acquired a strong
hold on the affections of every officer and
enlisted man at the post. He has been
particularly solicitous for the comfort of
the invalid and suffering veterans at the
general hospital, and his unflagging zeal
in attending to their wants, together with
his purely routine duties, left him little
time for recreation.
Chaplain Macomber is a Civil War vet
eran, having enlisted as a private in Au
gust, 1862, In the First Vermont Heavy
Artillery. He served as a corporal, ser
geant and first lieutenant, and was brev
etted captain for gallant and meritorious
service in the battle before Petersburg.
He was severely wounded on the head
and shot through the body in this en
gagement. He was appointed chaplain in
the regular army in 1880, his first station
being- Fort Custer, Mont. He served at
Fort'Sherman, Idaho, from 1887 to 1593,
and at Angel Island from 1893 to 4899.
Official notice has been received by the
headquarters of the Department of Cali
fornia from A'ashington that the District
of Alaska is no longer included In this
military district.
Practically all the casuals at the Pre
sidio embarked on the transport Sherman
for Manila yesterday, under the command
of Major Cowles. Lieutenant Colonel B.
F. Pope, assistant surgeon general, U. S.
A., who expected to sail on the Sher
man, received orders at the last moment
to remain here and assigning him to tem
porary duty in this department. The
change in his orders was undoubtedly due
to the fact that he will shortly be re
tired.
The transport Grant Is expected In
about a week with 200 sick soldiers from
Manila. % The bodies of fifty dead soldiers
were yesterday shipped from the Presidio
to relatives in the East.
The remains of Charles Stultz, Company
H, First Dakota Volunteers, will be bur
ied in the National Cemetery at the Pre
sidio at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
The medal committee of the Native
Sons of the Golden West has solved the
problem of distributing the medals to
those soldiers who enlisted from Califor
nia in the war with Spain, but who re
enlisted in other regiments at the expira
tion of their terms of service and re
mained in the Philippines. Stuart Har
vey of the Compania Marltlma. a steam
ship company operating vessels from Ma
nila to other parts of the Philippines and
Asiatic ports, has been appointed as an
agent for the soldiers to gather their en
listment and discharge papers, and to
make application for the medals and cer
tificates. The papers of the soldiers of
California who are at Manila will be per
sonally scanned by him. Soldiers of com
mands distant from that point will have
their papers certified to Mr. Harvey by
their company commanders. The medals
will be sent to Mr. Harvey, who will look
after their proper distribution.
A board of army officers has been ap
pointed at Washington, with Colonel J. L.
Rogers of the Fifth Infantry as its pre
siding officer, to report upon all the de
tails deemed desirable In harbor charts
for the use of the coast artillery. The
board was appointed at the request of
General Wilson, chief of engineers.
A board of officers, to consist of Captain
Frank West of the Sixth Cavalry and
Lieutenants R. F. Gardner and H. C.
Evans of the Third Artillery, has been
appointed to report upon the loss of cer
tain stores for which Major J. M. Carson,
quartermaster of the transport Thomas,
Is responsible.

22â¢ 'JAfiS CORLETTE and her mother are reconciled.
â¢ yyv/\ Yesterday afternoon she called on Mrs. Barrail
"ll )&> ac - Not many words passed between them. The
â¢ ** mother stretched out her arms. May fell upon her
â¢ neck. There were murmured "Forgive" nnd "God bless *
" you" and then the ready tears came to their relief and
\ anger and bitterness was a thine of the past.
When May Corlette- makes her debut with the Bosto
. nlans In Oakland, a week from Monday night; the mother
â¢ who so strenuously objected to her going . on the stage
' wlll.be there to witness her daughter's triumph. Â»{Â£-: *>.*-;
\ Mrs. Barraillac's objection to her daughter's devotion to
! music was based on an overscrupulous, simple, loving par
â¢ ent's fear that for the girl that steps out and beyond her
natural surroundings there is danger.
"Music brought May in Contact with people who were
more comfortable than she," she explained, "and I feared
that this gllmp'se of ease and luxury might give her tastes
that she could not gratify." *
Mrs. Barraillac was not won over easily. Friday morn
ing, shortly after 6 o'clock, her little girl stole over, to
her home on Fulton street and roused her. "Mother,", she |
said, "I have not slept a wink all night and -I came over to
see you before you got the morning paper."
"What have you done?" said the mother. â¢
"I have Joined the Bostonlans,". faltered the -girl.
Mrs. Barraillac gasped with fear. "Never, speak to; me -
again," she said and May, heart-broken, wandered away.'-
When the interviewer sought Mrs. Barraillac she was
still laboring under the excitement of the news her -
daughter had brought her. Her eyes were red and swollen. :
"I shall never forgive, May," she said, "never.". Grad
ually, however, anger gave place to a mother's! solicitude
and pride and she began to question as to the future dossl-
bllltles of her daughter. . "If she-should' not succeed,", she
cried. "Ah, but she is a good, noble girl and -must. ' She
has a grand voice." The upshot of it all was that a tender
â¢Â¦ message was. sent to. the daughter that is going on the
stage, and the reconciliation, is' now complete. " '..'..
As for May herself,' she. has 'not yet -entirely recovered
from the surprise of Thursday, "when" Mac Donald asked
her to Join, his' famous organization. * :
"The flrst night," she explained: yesterday,; "I did not
Bleep a wink._ Only to-day I. am beginning to realize all
that this may "mean to^me. Perhaps soon I will be able to
. have all I need and I 'am going to earn 'it . all with my.
music. I am not making .any preparations to. go. away. !
I can't. I have not l the: means to. I shall just have to
make the best of it. ;I;*am goingto study, hard and .work
hard and hope to succeed." Â» Â¦ â¢ .
~ Miss Corletteihas made rio plans for. the future. She
has never let her modest little self think further than the
possibility that one day t she might be fortunate enough to
get a position with an opera company. Such a thing as
grand opera has never entered -her unpretentious little
head. When . asked If she had any ambitions In that dlrec- '
tlon she said: "Oh, if. l only^ dared think of It!" [
Miss Corlette.wlll sing "in "The Â» "Viceroy" on Monday, .
February 26,' In" Oakland. On the 4th of March she will .
leave with the | Bostonlans for the East. Although a hand- .
satchel will now more than comfortably carry all the little .
girl's personal effects. It is more* than probable that when â¢
ehe returns to us it will be as a famous contralto with a Â¦
: maid and numberless Saratogas and scrapbookÂ»v crammed Â¦
"" with favorable notices, "and all the other accessories of a >
'great diva. - - Â¦ â¢â¢ â¢ . .
"Don't you' think that all that will come to pass?" she Â¦
was asked.- ; . â¢ -'-Â¦'â¢

District Attorney Byington, Satisfied Perjury
Prevails, Will take Steps to Have
the Guilty Parties Punished.
yj TTORNEY LOUIS F. DUNAND; a man of unquestioned
integrity, is one of the latest witnesses upon whom Mrs.
; Craven zvill rely to prove her claim to being the widow of
the late James G. Fair. Dunand's testimony will have a special
bearing on the Sausalito ceremony and zvill go to substantiate the
original story told by Justice Simpton. The exclusive publication
in The Call yesterday of the testimony that zvill be given for Mrs.
Craven by B. F. Lamborn proved to be the sensation of the day.
Yesterday the attention of the District Attorney was called to the
.evidence of perjury and bribery in the case and he has decided to
take immediate steps to bring the matter before the Grand Jury.
mltted and promised to put forth his best
efforts to bring the guilty parties to Jus
tice. The Grand Jury will be asked to
Investigate the charges, and aside from
the action it may take warrants may ba
issued for several of the principals in the
scandal. It was suggested to tho District
Attorney that he delay action In the cases
until after the Fair trial, now In prog
ress, should be terminated, but he took a
view similar to that of Pence & Pence,
that no time should be lost in putting a,
stop to the methods that are being prac
ticed in the Craven- Fair litigation.
Whichever side Is encouraging crime It la
the intention of the authorities to have
the guilty ones punished.

born, the City Clerk of Alameda. pub
lished exclusively in The Call of yester
day, produced a sensation equally as great
as Simpton's sudden change of heart.
Lamborn was somewhat surprised that
his story became public. He hastened to
this side of the bay early yesterday morn-
Ing and at once sought an Interview with
Mrs. Craven's attorneys. At the close of
the conference his lips were sealed. When
seen at his home in Alameda laat night
he refused positively to make any far
ther statement concerning the case, dis
missing the matter with the assertion
that when the proper time arrived ho
would tell h!a whole story.
Nowhere has the sensational develop^
ments In the litigation aroused more ex
citement than In Sausalito, where Attor
ney Sylva and Justice Slmpton reside. A
detachment of detectives, acting In tho
interests of both sides of the litigation,
are posted around Sylva's home and
sleuths greet every Incoming train and
boat.
Simpton essayed to gro around town yes
terday, but he was guarded by two Cur
tin men. He states that this Is a precau
tionary measure taken in view of the fact
that he Is being shadowed. The Judge,
while endeavoring to assume an off-hand
manner, has been visibly affected by the
tension which has been placed upon him
during the last few days. His faca
twitches involuntarily while he talks, and
in a shaking hand he holds a cigar, which
from time to time he nervously chews.
"I feel perfectly secure as to the out
come." he said to a Call representative.
"I have been acting In the interests of
law and honesty and feel that my conduct
should earn me the recognition of â¢very,
honest man."
Sylva absolutely refused to discuss tha
case or his connection with it.
the charter to give the power to tho Su
pervisors over the telephone company?
Certainly. I have a paper to that intent
in my pocket that I wished to Introduce
last Monday, but the time passed before
I had the opportunity. I am in favor of
such an amendment. I would vote for it.
Supervisor Tobinâ The local govern
ment should most decidedly have the right
to regulate the tolls of any corporation
that cl'arges so exorbitantly- as the tele
phone corporation. It is, of course, a
question of law, but If we cannot do it
there should be a commission, such as the
Bank Ccmmisslon, to attend to them. I
am not sure as to how the charter can
be amended so as to cover this apparent
defect.
Supervisor Curtis â The charter
should certainly contain a clause giving
the Supervisors the power to regulate all
these, corporations that supply public
warts. Gas, water, telephone and similar
ccrcerns should all â¢be treated alike. I
em not prepared to say just now how we
should go about the task.
Supervisor Helmsâ Telephone corpor
ations should have no more privileges
than other corporations. I thought there
was a clause in the charter that cave us
the right to regulate telephones. If it be
missing. It should certainly be put in as
fast as possible. I do not know whether
it would be advisable to hold another spe
cial election at this time.
Supervisor Connorâ l have not given
the matter any thought, but while I do
not see why there should be any discrim
ination between corporations I do not
think it advisable to hold a special election
at this time, when we are bankrupt. Â¦ If
we should vote bonds to. make up the de
ficiency in the city's income perhaps we
oov.ld at the same time pass upon an
amendment to the. charter placing tele
phone companies under our control. '
Supervisor D^rver â I cannot see why
telephone companies should not be sub
ject to the same legislation as other cor
porations, but as I have not given the
Manslaughter Not Proved.
The charges of manslaughter against J.
K. McCarthy and W. I*. Blakeslee were
dismissed by Judge Conlan yesterday, as
there was no evidence to support It. Dur

January 1 Francois Rachow was hit on
the head with a stone. He continued to
work for three weeks and was then Bent
to the French Hospital, where he died on
January 28. McCarthy and Blakeslee were
accused of being responsible for his death.

neous cargo, has been seized by the Brit-
ish gunboat Thrush and brought to Algoa

War Tax on Stock Transfers.
United States Internal Revenue Collec
tor John C. Lynch issued yesterday a
circular to brokers and others Interested
in stocks giving the decision* of the Com
missioner of Internal Revenue on certain
disputed points regarding the war tax.
In the circular Mr. Lynch says that the

though the beneficiary remains the- same.

MRS. HEARST ORDERS
THE GREAT WORK BEGUN
NEW TJNIVEBSITY A THING OF
THE NEAR FUTURE.
Architect Benard Is Busy Adapting
and Making Practical His Orig- ,
inal Flans.
The nlans drawn by M. Benard. the
famous French architect, for the new
California University, are to be simplified
before the are built upon, and M. Benard
Is already at work in Paris upon the mod
ified draft. Up to the time that Archi
tect Benard submitted his plans to the
jury of architects he j had not surveyed
the ground upon which the buildings were
to be erected, and because of this some
minor changes will prove necessary. His
scheme, as a totality, however, will be
carried out. and the first building, the
residence of the president of the univer
sity, will be begun during the present
year.
Mrs. Phebe Hearst, thanks to whose gen
erosity the brilliant future of the Univer
sity of California is due, has issued to
the public a concise statement and his
tory of the recent architectural contest
and as well, a handsomely bound volume
in which are printed the plans of M. Be
nard and the most worthy of his com
petitors, together with a running descrip
tion of them in the languages of those
who took part In the competition.
As Mrs. Hearst says, it will take time
and plenty of it to carry out the magnifi
cent plans which Benard has drawn, but
at the same time she makes the signifi
cant announcement that the work will be*
begun at once. M. Benard, In fact, prom
ises to have his revised plans ready by
October lof this year. The mining build
ing will be the second to be put in course
of construction.*
The new buildings proposed number
twenty-flve, and according to the state
ment made by Mrs. Hearst, they will av
erage in cost about $400,000 each. The to
tal cost, covering all, at a liberal esti
mate, would not exceed $13,000,000. As
planned" now by Mrs. Hearst, the presi
dent's home, the mining building, the ad
ministration offices, the auditorium and
the library and gymnasium will be 1 the
first to be constructed, and will rise in the
order in which they are named.

request he went to Slmpton and made him

Mr. Dunand is the attorney for one of
the Consuls of a Central American repub
lic. He is at present in Central America,
attending to some mining business In
which he is Interested, and Is expected to
return to this city in the near future.
The charges of bribery and perjury
which are now forming such a prominent
part in the celebrated case are to be
sifted to the bottom by the authorities
District Attorney Byington had the whole
matter presented to him yesterday by
Attorneys Pence & Pence, and he agreed
with them that an offense had been corn-
Citizens Will Be Called Upon to Give the
City Authorities Power to Supervise
and Regulate the Monopoly.
' J Supervisors have determined that the telephone monop-
J[ oly of this city shall not profit by the crafty scheme which
its agents worked in the charter convention to evade respon
sibility to the city authorities and regulation of its rates and tariffs
by the Board of Supervisors.
The Supervisors have determined, under the leadership of Su
pcrz'isor McCarthy, therefore, that steps shall be taken at once to
amend the charter to give the board the right to fix telephone rates.
A resolution will shortly be introduced and will zvithout doubt be
adopted and will then be submitted to the people for their indorse
ment.
THE agitation to bring the local tele
phone monopoly under the super
vision of the municipal authorities
and to treat it as other great cor
porations pupplyjng public utilities
are treated under the charter is al
ready bearing splendid fruit. The Board
cf Supervisors sees the gross favoritism
which hap been shown to the telephone
company. The members of the board have
fome knowledge of the crafty scheme
through which all mention of the tele
phone monopoly was omitted from the
charter. They recognize that a grave in
justice has be.Â»n done by dishonest and
cjuestionable means upon the people of
6an Frar.c'.sco. and a majority of the
board, following the lead of Supervisor
McCarthy In ihls matter, are determined
to remedy the evil.
Supervisor McCarthy has made a close
Ftudy of the question of telephone fares in
American cities. He is equipped with facts
ar.d figures to prove the tremendous ex
tortion of the local company, and he Is
preparing an order providing for an
cmcr.dment to the charter which he will
jiresent to the board. This amendment
will give to the Supervisors the right of
Fupervision over telephone companies and
the power to establish and fix rates for all
Fuch corporation?. An overwhelming ma
jority of the Supervisors are in favor cf
Fuch an amendment, so there is reason to
lielieve that the people of the city will
r.ot be cheated out of the rights which
crafty attorneys of the company have
eiolen from them.
The order which Supervisor McCarthy
â¢will present to the Supervisors must pass
through several stages before it will be
come a law and operative. It must flrst
fee adopted by the Board of Supervisors,
according to the provisions of the fitate
constitution. The Election Commission
must then present the order to the people
at a special or a general election, and the
people mvs t then adopt it by a three-fifths
vote. After this one step remainsâ the
amendment thus adopted must be ratified
ls\- the State Legislature, and with that
ratification the amendment becomes a
law.
It '.s universally conceded that the mat
ter should be taken up at once and that
c special election should be held. Some of
Ihe Supervisors are inclined to bellevo thm
a petition from fifteen per cent of the
voters who cast their ballots at the last
election is necessary to call a special elec
iloru Others Jo not think that such â¢Â» pe
tiilon is required, and that the Supervisors
reed only to demand of the Election Com
mission to call the election. To prevent
jfr.y possible Illegality the City Attorney
will be asked for his opinion.
One of the Supervisors thinks that the
rharter cannot be amended for two years,
but a strict reading of the State constitu
tion will show that there Is nothinc to
prevent such amendment at once, the only
restriction being that after the flrst
amendment has been adopted another
cannot be made until two years have
elapsed.
The Justice of the amendment no one
questions. It is known positively that the
telephone monopoly was saved from su
pervision and regulation through a plot.
The crafty corporation had at least one
representative among the freeholders and
he saw that the telephone company was
not molested in its piracy. The fraud of
emission was pot discovered until after
the charter was printed and then an em
phatic protest was madÂ«s but it was too
late. The Supervisors seem determined,
therefore, to correct the evil which has
l>een done.
Of all the gigantic corporations which
have for years sucked their tremendous
profits from the purse of complacent San
Francisco the telephone company is least
hampered in its practical larcenies by
er.y provisions of law. By deliberate con
r.lvance one at least of those who framed
the new basic law of the municipality
quite overlooked Mr. Sabin's philanthrop
ic monopoly and surrounded Mr. .Sabin's
thousands of patrons with no safeguards
epainst the well exercised acqisitiv* pro
clivities of his company. Spring Valley
"Water, the San Francisco Gas and Elec
tric Company and its numerous profitable
tranches and the power companies are to
t certain extent hedged In by legislation
which circumscribes to a large degree
their earning capacity and gives the con
turner of their wares a fair chance of get
ting value received for his cash donations.
It Is otherwise, however, with the Pa
dfl'J Telephone Company. That organi
sation Is accountable to no one save its
president for its profits or for its ex
penses. In law there is no limit to the
c-xtortion it may practice nor does the
company recognize any limit. Under the
present conditions it may go along In the
uneven tenor of its way, charging a dif
ferent rate for every customer and man
ipulating its niekel-in-the-slot machines
In such a manner that they become sta
tionary pickpockets in the home of every
one who Is unfortunate enough to need
It was thought at first that the charter
carried a provision which would at least
mitigate these conditions; but after a
careful study of the city's new municipal
law Supervisor William M. McCarthy dis
covered that although gas, electric and
Â¦water companies come within the super
vision and direction of the Board of Su
pervisors, the telephone company does
not. Each year the other corporations are
compelled to appear before the board with
Ftateraenta of their earnings and ex
penses, in order that the board may fix
a. reasonable minimum rate which . they
may charge for their x commodities.
Etrarge to Bay, however, the telephone
company is not amenable to these pro
visions.
Supervisor McCarthy propose* to place
the telephone company in the same cate
tory aa the others. For weeks ha has 1
been studying closely the telephone situa
.tion and has made many startling discov
eries. He has learnod that the local com
pany is almost If not quite the largest of
Its kind in America; also that its tolls are
nearly 100 per cent higher than others. He
Is convinced that the telephone-using pub
lic of San Francisco is the victim of one
of the most outrageous cinches that ever
disgraced a municipal government, and
shortly he will attempt so to amend the
charter that Mr. Sabin's company will be
governed by the same law that governs
the other corporations. He is having pre
pared at the present time the resolution
carrying the necessary amendment, and
will have it ready for submission to the
board within the next ten days.
If the board adopts itâ and there is
small doubt that it willâ the amendment
will next go before the people either at
the coming: general election or at a special
election called for the purpose before that
time.
"My idea is." said Mr. McCarthy, in
speaking of his project yesterday, "to
place the telephone company, with the
other local monopolies, under the super
vision of the Board of Supervisors and
then establish a flat rate for telephone
service, which will assure a reasonable
profit to the company and protection for
the patrons against the present system
of extortion. Five or six per cent at the
most is a fair profit for a corporation of
this sort. To give you an Idea of what
its profits must beâ the Metropolitan Com
pany of New York invested 5000,000 in its
plant, and in five years its net profits
amounted to J2.840.000. Compared with
the local telephone company, the gas and
water companies are novices in the art of
cinching patrons. The Metropolitan Com
pany charged an annual rate of $60 on all
telephones â about half the rate charged
by the Pacific Company. You may draw
from that what its profits foot up. I pro
pose as a remedy that the charter be
amended, and I will soon offer to the
board a -resolution embodying the neces
sary amendment. I am confident it will
meet with little if any opposition."
Seventeen of the eighteen Supervisors
were seen yesterday and nearly all of
them agreed with Mr. McCarthy that an
immediate remedy is necessary and that
the plan he proposed seemed most feas
ible. In fact. Mr. McCarthy's amendment
bids fair to be popular with about every
one save Mr. Sabin. Concerning it the
members of the board declared them
selves as follows:
Supervisor Boxtonâ l am in favor of
en amendment to the charter to give the
Supervisor's the power to regulate thy: tel
ephone rates. I would votfl for such nn
amendment, and I am confident thac most
cf the other Supervisors feel the same
v/a y.
Supervisor Duboceâ Yes. I think that
the telephone company ought to cc as
much subject to regulation as are the
water, gas and other corporations that
use the street* and give public service. I
would vote for an amendment to tlfe char
ter to give the Supervisors the necessary
power.
Supervisor Jenninersâ l cannot say
off-hand whether I would vote to amend
the charter to give the regulation of the
telephone to the Supervisors; but I see no
reason why all the corporations that have
public privileges and give public service
bhot'ld not be subject to the same degree
of regulation by the Supervisors.
Supervisor Boothâ l am in favor of
amending the charter to make the tele
phone company subject to regulation by
the Supervisors. I would certainly vole
for an amendment to effect that.
Supervisor Reedâ The charter needs
amendment to give the Supervisors the
Fame degree of control over the telephone
that they now have In reference to the
other semi-public corporations that use
the streets. The Call had an excellent edi
torial on the eubject. I will vote for the
amendment suggested, but I believe that
the charter cannot be amended for two
years.
Supervisor Fontanaâ l, would have to
give the. matter of amending the charter
to bring the telephone service under ree
ulation by the t-upervlsors some thought,
for I have never considered the matter. I
Jo not care to fay anything more about
the matter until I have thought it over.
Supervisor d'Anconaâ Would I amend
WHILE the forces engineering the
Fair end of the Craven-Fair lit
igation are resting on their
oars, apparently satisfied that
they have blown the opposition
out of the water with. the Slmpton bomb
shell, Mrs. Craven's attorneys have
not been Idle and have prepared a
few counter-sensations which they Intend
to spring in Judge Troutt's court Monday
morning. They are also getting the evi
dence together by which they expect to
prove that the Marin Justice of the Peace
told the truth when he made a deposition
to the effect that he had performed the
ceremony which made Senator Fair and
Mrsi Craven man and' wife and that he
committed perjury when he subscribed to
an affidavit -In which he claimed he had
fabricated in his flrst sworn statement.
Among the' important witnesses upon
whom Mrs. Craven will rely to puncture
holes in Simpton's latest story is Louis
F. Dunand, formerly a resident of San
Rafael, an attorney of prominence and a
man who bears an enviable reputation
among all who know him. Attorney Sylva
in his â¢ early statements of the Slmpton
ceremony frequently made mention of a
third party who was. present when the
Justice of the Peace gave out the Infor
mation that he had married Fair and Mrs.
Craveni Louis" F. Dunand was that party.
His testimony will go to prove that many
months previous to the time when it was
charged that Mrs. Craven offered to pay
Simpton and Sylva $10,000 to concoct the
ceremony story Slmpton had stated in
Dunand's hearing and in the presence of
Sylva. that he possessed evidence that
would be valuable to Mrs. Craven's side
of the litigation, and finally volunteered
the information that he had married the
millionaire and the woman who is now
fighting for a snare of his property.
Â¦It is expected that it will be shown by
the testimony of Dunand that that was
the flrst Sylva knew of Simpton's connec
tion with the affairs of Mrs. Craven and
the'late Senator Fair. This would be in
direct contradiction of the statement of
Sylva that the whole story was oulined
to him by Mrs. Craven and that at her

matter much thought I will not pronounce
judgment at' this time.- -. ; â¢Â¦
Supervisor Masruireâ l have not given
the subject any thought and do not wish
to express myself hastily. I cannot see.
though, why all such corporations should
not be treated alike. â¢
Supervisor Comte â There should be
power vested in the Board of .Supervisors
to control the i propensities of such cor
poratlons as "telephone companies. I^un
derstand that the Judiciary committee of
the board of freeholders omitted the tele
phone company from supervision because
of a belief that such a clause would be
illegal. This can hardly be the casa, for
if it be right to regulate gas and water
it surely cannot be wrong to attend to the
telephone companies.
Supervisor BrandenstÂ«inâ l doubt
the wisdom of leaving to any legislative
body the regulation of concerns requiring
co much expert knowledge, but bo long aa
we are empowered to fix gas and water
rates . I cannot see why telephones . and
similar utilities should not be included. It
was the purpose of the charter to attend
to all these things. I will not say off-hand
if we have the legal right to take the
step proposed by Supervisor McCarthy, i
Supervisor Sandersonâ l do not care
to express any opinion, for I have not
looked into the matter at all. . I am net
tied to the telephone company nor to any"

STANDER'S TALE
IS DENIED BY
THE DIRECTORS
Declare He Was Not
Swindled.
Sixty thousand dollars Is the sum that
A. F. Btander claims to have lost In a
deal in Algol copper stock, and he is now
seeking to have the Grand Jury indict the
late directors of the company. The his
tory of the sale of the Btock to Stander
shows that he was not as innocent of min
ing transactions as he would have the
Grand Jury believe.
"There is not the slightest ground for
blaming the company," eaid one' of the
late directors yesterday", "btander is a
mining man of experience, and twice in
epected :he property in Placer Cougty
before he made his investment. Tne imne
had been declared the very -best copper
prospect in tlie State by no lefes an au
thority than Mr. LHedeshetmer, who ex
perted the great lodes on the Comstock.
tftander had been in Alaska and owned
the claim next to that of Berry. He
claimed to be an expert, and not until
after he had personally been to the Algol
mine did he buy W,w) worth of stock.
We organized a company, with Charles
Kinglev. Mr. Goetz, Carl Goetz, H. bchim
mt:i and Charles Stepp as directors. After
assays that showed $32 to the ton we
spent all of the money put in by Stander
for development, as the books will show.
We had obtained a bond from the owner
for one year, and this has been renewed,
so that It is good till January 1 of next
year and has not lapsed, as Stander told
the Grand Jury.
"The property Is owned by a Mr. French
and is very valuable if we can get the
money to develop it. This is how stander
came" to be another JW.OoO out. He came
bark from Alaska and was so well pleased
with the work done that, although he at
first raid he would put no more money in
copper, he later bought 17,000 shares from
Getz and 3000 from Schlmmel at $2 apiece.
This was their private stock, and of
courÃe they did not pay the money to the
company. This was in violation of an
agreement that the directors had made
to pool their stock and not to sell until
the mine was fully developed, Â»o that tho
stock in the treasury could be disposed of
and some money raised. Before making
this second buy. however, Stander visited
the mine and saw what had been done.
Selby's certificates show what the ore is
worth and the shafts at the mine show
what developing has been done.
"As soon as Stander got the control of
the stock he at once elected himself pres
ident and now has all the books showing
what has been accomplished. It Is true
he put $60,000 into the mine, but he has
the option and the stock and purchased
only after a thorough investigation.
There is nothing shady about the deal,
but he made the mistake of buying from
individuals instead of from the treasury
of the company. Had the $40,000 that he
paid to Goetz and Schimmel been used to
develop the mine Stander would have
realized a big fortune from his Invest
ment."

The steamer Rio de Janeiro took away
a very large cargo for the Orient, but
only a small passenger list. Among those
booked for Hongkong were Edwin Rob
bins and wife. The young couple were
the center of attraction on the mail dock
as their trip to Hongkong is in the na
ture of a runaway match. Young Rob
bins was quietly wedded to his" cousin.
Miss M. Miller, yesterday afternoon and
the couple then took passage for the
Orient. The father of the young man
was on the wharf yesterday and did his
best to keep the bride and groom In San
Francisco, but they were deaf to his en
treaties and sailed on the Rio.
The hospital ship Missouri docked at
the Government wharf yesterday. There
are some necessary repairs to be "made
on her, but Inside of a fortnight she will
be on her way back to Manila to bring
home another load of convalescents. Cap
tain Dillon says that the stories about
his vessel being unseaworthy are abso
lutely without foundation.
Another gasoline .crab boat was blown
up early yesterday morning owing to
gross carelessness. The fishermen were
getting the boat under way when one qC
them dropped a lighted match into the
bilge. There was some gasoline th,at had
leaked out of the tank there and the re
sult was a fla/eup that blew a hole in
the bottom of the small boat. She began
to settle and the crab hunters got ashore
before the boat finally went to the bot
tom. Later a diver went down and by
means of tackle rigged to the French
bark Canrobert the gasoline boat was
raised and will be repaired and ready for
sea in a few days.
The tug Lottie broke her shaft off Arch
Rock yesterday and was drifting out to
sea when the quarantine steamer George

IMPERIALISM THE ISSUE.
Monticello Club Discusses Prospects
.;Â¦'/. "Â¦:'.:_. of the Campaign.
That the Democrats are very much at
spa regarding the place the financial ques
tion will occupy In the next campaign
was proved by the discussion hold at the
Monticello Club last evening. Every the
ory or point advanced was warmly de
bated and the preponderance of opinion
was that the most important plank in
the national platform this year will be
that of Imperialism and all that it im
pllrs.
. Judge K. A. Bridgford opened the de
bate, and stated that if the Democratic
party went before the country- this fall
with: the cry of 16 to 1 It would be de
feated. He favored a plan of Issuing cer
tificates by the national treasury that
would be redeemable In value but not In
money. Gavin McNab, Warren Olney Jr.
and others thought there were many de
fects to the system. Curtis Hillyer de
clared that the people did not ask for
a change in the financial system four
years ago. but that the question was
forced upon the people and ended in the
wreck of the party.
Judge Lawlor did not think that the
party managers made the Issues, but said
the people made them and the party lead
ers followed public opinion. He said that
there was nothing to show that the mone
tary, question was now tho dominant Is
sue, but there was much to show that
imperialism would be the Issue with
which the Democratic party would go be
fore the country this fall.
It was announced thai the club will dis
cuss "Imperialism* at its. next smoker,
and that Benjamin Ide Wheeler would
speak.

RIFLE TOURNAMENT EVENTS.
Fine Programme and Liberal Prizes
for the Schuetzenbund.
The local committees of the third na
tional schuetzenbund are working hard
to complete arrangements for the great
rifle tournament which is to take place
here from June 30 to July 8, inclusive.
Marksmen of world-wide reputation from
all parts of the country will be in at
tendance and large sums of money will
have to be raised for prizes, to say noth
ing of the many medals and trophies to
be competed for. It is estimated that
cash prizes will amount to $10,000.
The matter of selecting a rangÂ© has
received much consideration. The two
big ranees are at Shell Mound and
Bchuetzen parks, the former having the
more targets. At a meeting of one of the
committees recently bids for the tourna
ment were received from the managers of
the resorts, but no action was taken, the
bids not being satisfactory. In the East
the managers of parks offer thousands of
dollars for the tournament, as the con
cessions of various kinds are valuable. In
order to make the event a success here
these concessions must bring a good price.
At the last meeting of the programme
committee the following targets and
events were decided upon:
Targets for members â German 25-ring target.
Eureka point target, Germanla. On these tar
gets only members of the National Schuetzen
bund can compete. About $7000 will be distrib

INSURANCE
MEN DOWN
CALIFORNIA
Easy Victory of the Fireman's
Fund Over the Blue and
Gold.
Fireman's Fund 9, California 3.
Nothing but victories roll along the way
of the Fireman's Fund Insurance baseball
team. Yesterday at Recreation grounds
they put the University of California" nine
under several feet of damp earth and cel
ebrated afterward over the funeral.
A week before a corporal's guard saw
tho game between the insurance men and
Stanford. Half a corporal's guard was
present at the game yesterday, freezing
for the lack of baseball thrills that a slow
and uninteresting game made Impossible.
Eleven times the Blue and Gold men were
guilty of baseball crimes, and they were
punished by a bitter defeat.
The first part of the game showed the
Blue and Gold colors in a brief spasm of
advantage. In the iirst inning two runs
were made, Hamlln and Braley crossing
the rubber. Kaarsberg twirled well
enough to prevent runmaking, and Krug
was touched up a bit by the collegians.
But it was the last part of the game that
showed the California team in its spe
cialty of bewhlskered errors. Kaarsberg
was the arch-offender, all due to a mis
take of vision. Second base and center
field could not be distinguished apart by
the Blue and Gold pitcher and in attempt
ing to catch- the runner at second Kaars
berg would pitch frequently to far center.
The one feature of the game was the
home run of Braley in the eighth. He hit
the ball to the farthest corner of the
field, beyond the flagpost. The score is:

HAWKER THE
CHOICE OF
BETTORS
English Greyhound Is Selected
to Win at Union Cours
ing Park,
Kay & Tranfs English greyhound.
Hawker, was installed favorite for the
stake at Union Coursing Park yesterday.
Thfs was before he met and defeated
Pasha Kennels' Round About. As it
proved a severe course it will have some
effect on the bis brindle dog's running
to-day. Another such effort may take
much of the speed out of him and tnus
ruin all his chances for the stake. The
dogs from the Lopez Kennels axe run
ning noli and are expected to work their
way well into the etalie. Those still In
the running are: Pepita. Green Valley
ilaid, Wonder, Diablo and Wanda, a for
midable list.
There were the- usual upsets In the
betting. One Spot beat Sleety Mist at
1 to 5; Night Time beat Gladiator. 1 to 4;
Magneto beat Twin City Girl, 1 to 2; May
Hemi^te&U beat America, 1 to 3; Echo
beat Warrior. 1 to 2; Brian Bora beat
War Eag>, 1 to 2; Master Mat beat Pat
Heilly. i to b.
Athena and Lady Hugo ran three
courses before the former won. The same
was true of Motto and For Glory. The
dogs ran under adverse conditions, a
thick foe, close- to the ground, obscuring
the doss' vision. 'i he coursing to-day
should be jjood as the dogs are evenly
matched. There is an absence of repre
sentatives of the champion class, but
those in tho running press the limit
closely. The results of the running yes
terday, with the official scores, follows:

to be fitted out with her machinery, but brought with her the largest load of lumber ever sent out of Grays Har

without an accident, but the Robert Dollar has over a million feet aboard and had no trouble whatever in crossing

SHE ESSAYED TO
DECAPITATE HER
SLEEPING HUBBY
Woman With Sword
Attempts Murder.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway. Feb. 17.
Mrs. Marjjaretha Runnels attempted to
decapitate her husband. Oscar G. Run
nels, with a sword while he was asleep
la*t night and to-day she was ordered
*er.t to Agnews Asylum by Judge Greene.
The woman, who is young and handsome.
1* Paid to be possessed of a homicidal and
euicidal mania, which has exleted for
eeverel months. ;.;
Her husband, who is the manager of the
Ehasta Water Company at HIS Broadway,
pays that she has been possessed of an
Insane Jealousy for nearly a -year. Sev
eral months ago he sent her to a private
rafiitarlum, but she waa discharged with
out beinc cured. Last August she at
tempted to commit suicide by jumping
from a ferry-boat, but was restrained.
Since then she has frequently threat
ened to kill her husband. He thought it
Â»ass hallucination which his wife would
never attempt to carry into effect until
last night, while he was asleep, she crept
out of bed and secured an old sword.
'Til kill you!" she remarked, as she
pnealv^d toward her husband with the
rleamlnp blade uplifted.
Just as the tatai stroke was to
descend Runnels awoke. He quickly
jrrappied with his maddened wife and
after a hard Â¦trugpl^ managed to disarm
her. Afterward she attempted to pass
the matter off as a joke and talked so
plausibly that for a while the examining
physicians and the Judge were In '. a
quandary.
"J did not suppose my husband would
take the matter periously," she said. "I
don't know why I did it. Women do a
great many peculiar things when they
care for their hupbsjids. -1 love my hus
hand and want to live with him. I know
I can restrain myself If I will. AM 1 ob-
Ject to is having my husband talk with
vr>nen I do not like. That woman Miss
FÂ«~ott has told a lot of falsehoods about
me. She and my husband have been too
intimate.
"I have been accused by mv husband of
having killed our little child. That iÂ« not
true. What I said was that the Bible
fays that the sins of the parents are vis
i*ed upon their offspring and our little
one may have been taken away as a
judgment by the Ix>rd for my husband's
actions with Miss Scott."
Miss Scott, the young lady of whom
Mrs. Runnels Is so Insanely Jealous, says
that the latter is possessed of a homicidal
mania. She also declares that the, afflict
ed woman has no reason to accuse her of
wrongdoing.

NEWS OF THE BAY CITIES OAKLAND ALAMEDA COUNTY BERKELEY
. Â¦ J
Physicians Are
Astonished at
Dp. $el?ridge's
Recovery.
OAKLAND, Feb. IT.â The wonderful
action of the X-ray In the case of |
Dr. J. M. Selfridge of this city has
attracted wide attention in all di
rections, but particularly in the
rardical profession has interest
ti<Â»en develoned. The results of the ex
periments upon Dr. Selfridge are being
watched very closely, not alor.e by Dr. N.
11. Chamberlain, the physician who is j
conducting the experiments, but by other
physicians, who are awaiting the result.
A few physicians are inclined to doubt
whether a cure has been effected, and Dr.
Chamberlain will only say that a "prac- j
tlcal cure" -has been accomplished. But
one thing is certainâ while, a few months
ago, the cancer was eating into the face
of Dr. Selfridge, fatal progress has been
stayed, and the wound that has existed j
for twenty-five years is surely healing. I
Clean tissue is forming, and save for the j
injury already done to the face and nose ,
by the cancer there Is every Indication of ;
a complete cure. ;
The application of the X-ray treatment i
was suggested by Dr. Self ridge himself, j
He consulted with Dr. Chamberliln and [
his son. Dr. C. M. Selfridge, and they de- j
termlned to make a series of experiments. |
Dr. Selfridge declared he was willing to i
take almost any risks, so dangerous had '
the cancer become. He knew that it was
but a question of time when the cancer
would reach some vital spot, unless Its
progress could be arrested. Life was to
him shadowed by the blot of his dreadful |
affliction. Surgery had proved Ineffectual,
and he determined to try the efficacy of
the X-ray. Hawing reached this decision
the experiments were begun last October, |
and they have continued up to the pres- :
ent.
The first great danger to be guarded
against was the penetrating power of the j
powerful X-ray. This strange light was {
known to produce a peculiar irritating re- j
suit when brought in contact with healthy |
tissue. It was absolutely necessary to ;
prevent this, and that caused no small j
amount of study and work. It was for
this purpose that the lead mask was
made. Sheets of pure lead were secured
and rolled very thin with jewelers' rollers.
The mask was then made from this so
as to cover the entire face and completely i
protect the healthy tissue. A small hole, I
the exact size and shape of the cancer- j
ous wound; was cut in the mask so that
the light would fall only upon the dis
eased part.
The experiments were conducted in Dr.
Chamberlain's olfice. The patient was
placed on a regular surgeon's operating
table. The mask was fitted carefully ovt-r
his face and the exposure was made from j
a regular Crookes tube. The exposures
were raised a little and were decreased
In frequency and duration as orten as a
change was noticeable. Beneficial. results
were almost immediately apparent. The I
X-ray seemed to dry up the cancer and |
stop its <]< adly work and to-day Dr. Self- j
riiige's friends are rejoicing over his re
covery from the terrible malady that they
feared would eventually cause Ms death.
Those physicians who have closely f
watched the experiment believe that a
cure has at last been lound for cancer
when the growth is so situated that it
can bÂ« reached by the X-ray. What ef
fect the X-ray might have upon internal
cancers and tumors that are hidden be
math healthy tissues Is something that
remains yet to be proved, but that ex
posed cancers can be stopped successfully
ihe S'lfridge experiments show. The ex
periments are still young, but they have
opened a vast held for research and spec

In regard to the results of his experi
ments Dr. < "ham berlain to-day said:
"I regret the premature publicity of this
X-ray treatment of cancer, believing that
the mattfr should come before the medi

for exhaustive experimentation be given.
Now thai the matter has become public,
however. I will say that so far as present

least suggestive, and th<- results attained
in the case of Dr. Selfrldge are truly mar
velous.
"It was at the doctor's own suggestion
and solicitation that we began the experi
ment in his case, for he had reached such
a state of misery from his affliction that
he was willing to take chances in an ex
periment that, so far as we knew, might
iesu!t in disaster. The result, however,
has been published and has encouraged us
to continue the experiment in other cases.
These also show favorable signs, but it Is
entirely too soon to fay what the results
will be, for it will take months and even
years of experience and observation to
prove or disprove the curative effect of
this powerful agent. If success continues
as it has begun, one of the most dreaded
of human maladies will be robbed of its
horrors." ;-â¢"â¢;
The various physician? regard the mat
ter in different lights. Those of the same
school as Dr. Chamberlain regard the re
pults aÂ« satisfactory proof that a cure for
cancer has been found. Those of the reg
ular school are more doubtful, though by
no means denying the very apparent re
sults of the experiments.
Dr. I. E. Nicholson, who witnessed
some of the experiments, believes that a
cure has been made. He said:
"I certainly believe that there is a great
future before us with the X-ray. I have
followed the experiments of Dr. Chamber
lain closely and I am compelled to be
lieve my eyes. I saw Dr. Selfridge when
the cancer was In Its most malignant
form and I have seen It heaJ, day by day,
under the X-ray treatment. We who have
peen the experiment believe that it has
most effectively removed the cancerous
growth and it is my belief that when the
cancer is so situated that the X-ray can
be applied It will be generally used by
the medical profession as the only avail
able remedy. The experiments so far
have been entirely satisfactory and I am
satisfied that the X-ray cure will be in
general use for the treatment of cancers
within a very short time."
Dr. A. 3. Larkey paid: V.-. '
"The X-ray experiment Is really In its
infancy, but already a great deal has been
accomplished. Personally, I have had lit
tle experience in the matter, but my faith
in the X-ray is such that I am at present
negotiating for a machine. When I was
In New York last June I watched many
experiments and I then became convinced
DR. J. M. SELFRIDGE.
After suffering from cancer of
the face for twenty-five years Dr.
J. M. Selfrldge, the founder of
Fablola Hospital, has been almost
completely cured by the X-ray.
Last October Dr. . Self ridge be

sufferers have taken the same rem
edy and have met with like aston
ishing relief. As far as the trial
has gone, it seems that a check
has been discovered for the dread
cancer scourge.
that the X-ray would be very valuable
from a therapeutical. standpoint. In the
case of Dr. Selfridge the treatment has
not been carried on long enough for us to
reach a definite conclusion, but the re
sults so far have been very encouraging.
There is not a bit of doubt that the X
ray treatment has had a very noticeable
healing effectâ l might say that it haa al
most healed, and we know that it haa al
leviated pain. Dr. Selfridge suffered the
most excruciating pain for years and now
the cancer never troubles him. If that
alone were the only thing it had accom
plished I would say that It was a great
boon to mankind and the medical profes
sion. I look for some remarkable results
within the next few years."
The regular school Is skeptical, but wfll
not positively deny the cure.
Dr. Eva L. Harris said:
"The X-ray has a great many possibili
ties and has accomplished a great many
things, but I can hardly believe that it
has been able to kill a cancerous growth.
Still, it Is possible, and I am not denying
it. 1 am merely skeptical and refusp to
believe it until 1 see it done or read of an
instance in some reputable medical jour
nal."
Dr. J. Maher said:
"It may be possible that the X-ray has
cured cancer, but I can hardly believe it.
Still, a great many wonderful things are
discovered by scientists, who are Â¦con
stantly experimenting. The ordinary prac
titioner can hardly ever do anything- of
that sort, and when a discovery like that
is made we arc loth to believe it. Still, /
will not say that It is impossible."
Dr. E. J. Boyes said:
"It may be that Dr. Selfridge has
cured a cancerous growth on his. face by
the use of the Roentgen ray, but I doubt
It. Mind you, I do not say that it 13 not
so. but I would want to see it done before
I acquiesce In such a statement. Science
is making great strides and wonderful
discoveries are being made every- day. â¢ So
it is possible that Dr. Selfridge has jÂ»*Â«ia
this one."
Dr. E. R. Sill said:
"I don't think that the X-ray Is. a cure
for cancer. Still I will not deny it and
shall not give an authoritative opinion
until I make a thorough investigation."
Dr. L. F. Herrlck said:
"It may be true that Dr. Selfridge haa
cured a cancer by the use of the X-ray,
but I doubt it. The X-ray has been put
Dr.Chaniberiain

Remedy.
* .
to a great many uses, but I r.ever h?ard
of it being applied to a cancerous growth
before. It is possible that it has accom
plished what Dr. Selfridge claims, ar.d I
nope so."
Dr. E. H. Woolsey said:
"If Dr. Selfridge has discovered a cure
for cancer by the use of the X-ray he has
done a wonderful thing. However. I
would not ltt him experiment with one 0..
my patients. He can try it on himself all
he plea^ep. but I doubt the efficacy of his
newly discovered treatment."
Dr O. D. Hamlin said:
"The first Roentgen ray that was ever
used in California was brought here by
me. I have experimented with it in a
great many ways and Know that a great
many things can be accomplished by it.
I have read of Dr. R*!frid?e's use of It
on a cancer, but shall view the alleged
cure very skeptically until I make a more
complete investigation of it. Jt may be
that he has accomplished what hÂ»Â» claims,
but it looks very improbable. I do not
deny It. however, but simply cannot be
lieve it until I get more proof."
SAN FRANCISCO WILL
HEAR W. NAT FRIEND
OAKLAND, Feb. 17.â William Nat
Friend will preach to-morrow night from
the pulpit of Dr. Mackenzie in the First
Presbyterian Church In San Francisco. He
will use as a text, "Why Follow Chri?t?"
which drew such a large audience in Oak
land last Sunday nigljt. It will be the
game sermon as that delivered in Oakland
and will be repeated by special request
for the San Francisco audience.
Mr. Frfend is probably as well known in
San Francisco as he Is in Oakland. Dur
ing his political and newspaper career he
became acquainted with a large number
of people there and It Is probable that his
congregation across the bay will be as
large and as cosmopolitan as that which
listened to his initial pulpit oration.
Dr. Mackenzie, whose pulpit Mr.
Friend will occupy, is the president of the
Pacific Theological Seminary, where the
young theological student is taking his
divinity course.

Life Romance of Lieu
tenant Avery.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Feb. 17.
A romance will be closed on Wednes
day next, or possibly It will have only
Just begun, when Lieutenant Howard
Avery and Miss Carrie Coit will become
husband and wife. Within a very, few
days Lieutenant Avery will depart for the
Philippine Islands to rejoin his regiment,
and possibly the romance will have only
just begun.
The Avery-Colt engagement lias existed
amid the roar of Philippine war and bat
tles for many months and has been one
of the important social engagements of
Oakland, but the date of the wedding has
never been announced until now.
Howard Avery was a student at the
State University at Berkeley and at the
outbreak of the war with Spain he en
listed in the Seventeenth United States
regular infantry a3 a private. He was
determined to fight for his country, even
if he did it In the ranks, and he sailed
away for that far distant land under the
tropic sun.
But before he left he told a story of
that which ranks with war and before
he left his engagement was announced to
Miss Carrie Coit, one of the belles of
Oakland.
Then Private Howard Avery went with
his- regiment across the ocean to win lau
rels and promotion for heroism and to re
turn a lieutenant. He was made a ser
geant before he had fairly seen action
and for bravery at the battle of block
house 14, where the Americans made such
a brilliant charge, he was promoted to a
lieutenancy.
The promotion came while he was In
the trenches and he was made a lieuten
ant on the field.
He was wounded and contracted the
fever and some months ago was invalided
home. It was about two months apo that
his mother died suddenly at her Sausalito
home, and that postponed the wedding
day.
Now the couple will be married â¢on
Wednesday at Trinity Church. Only the
families will be present, owing to the
death of Mrs. Avery. and there will be
no wedding attendants.
Lieutenant Avery will very shortly re
turn to duty In the Philippines and will
be accompanied by his wife.
ALAMEDA TEAM WINS.
Basket-Ball Game Which the Asso

ALAMEDA, Feb. 17.â A large crowd of
enthusiasts saw the Alameda High School
team defeat the Cardinals of the San
Francisco Y. W. C. A. this afternoon by a
score of 1 to 0. The Alamedans Â¦ were
slighter than their opponents, but made up
for that disadvantage by superior quick
ness and teamwork at critical moments.
The playing was open and fair, only two
of the Cardinals being obliged to retire on
account of Injuries.
The game consisted of two twenty
minute halves. At the end of the first
half honors were even and no score waa
made, though the ball was kept almost
entirely In Cardinal territory. The second
promised to end without a point for either
side, until four minutes before time was
called. Alameda then scored. Irma Sen
der was given the ball on a foul, and from
the fifteen-yard line tossed it into the bas
ket, making one point.
The High School players were: Touch

CRAZED BY THE OUTRAGE
OF HER LITTLE DAUGHTER
OAKLAND, Feb. 17.â Crazed by j grief,
Mrs. Marie Harris started to 'commit
homicide to-day, and was only prevented
from so doing by the opportune arrival of
Detective Shorey. He had a desperate
struggle with the woman, and finally suc
ceeded in disarming her, after which he
had her sent to tho insane department of
ihr Receiving Hospital.
The woman is the wife of a Pullman car
porter and lives at 502 Walsworth avenue.
Six weeks ago her eight-year-old daugh
ter was criminally assaulted by Leon
Humphrey.fa colored youth, who lives In
the same neighborhood. The child made
no mention of the matter to her parents
Â¦
until yesterday, when she told her moth
er. Instead of informing the police Mrs.
Harris secured a revolver and started on
a hunt for young Humphrey. The Btory
of her child had driven her violently in
sane and she declared that she would
kill the boy.
"I'll shoot him and my daughter and
then myself," she shouted. Detective
Shorey, who happened to bo in the neigh
borhood, heard the cries of the frantic
woman and immediately started to take
her into custody. She made a strenuous
resistance and in the scufile attempted to
shoot him. After being Incarcerated In
the Insane ward of the Receiving Hospi
tal it became necessary to put a stralt
lacket upon the maniac to prevent her
from committing suicide- Young Humph
rey was arrested and confessed nis crime.
The father of the child Is away on a trip
and will not be home until next Tuesday.

BURGLAR WHOSE
GREED LANDS HIM
IN THE BASTILE
Stole More Than He
Could Conceal.
Â»
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. Feb. 17.
The local police force is congratulating
Itself upon the capture this morning of a
clever burglar who broke into the home
of Clement C. Clay, East Fourteenth
street and Twenty-seventh avenue, took
everything he could carry away and was
about to make his departure on the creek
route ferry when he was apprehended. It
was not till Detective Shorey, who made
the arrest on suspicion, had taken the
prisoner to the City Hall, that the stolen
articles were found, and it was not till the
prisoner had made a confession that any
body knew that the burglary had baen
committed.
The prisoner gave his name as Jacob
Humel and said he had effected an en
trance to the Clay home by forcing the
lock of a window which opened onto a
veranda. The burglary was committed
between Â» and 6 o'clock while the Inmates
were asleep, and so stealthily did the man
work that no one was the wiser for sev
eral hours later.
How the man managed to secrete so
many article.* about his person Is a mys
tery. A large plush dolman and some
underclothing he had wrapped In a paper
and in his pockets were found two dozen
cigars, two silver hand mirrors, four silk
handkerchiefs, bearing the initials "I. C.
S.;" two pair of pearl and silver mounted
opera glasses, one of which bore the In
itials "M. '/.. S.;" several silver button
hooks and shoe slides, two manicure sets
complete, a pair of field glasses, a bulls
eye lantern, two silver Jewelry cases, gold
and silver thimbles, a black muffler with
the Initials "C. C. C." and other silver
mounted toilet articles. In a leather
purse was found $5 95 and In a silver purse
was found $25 in gold. Most of the
articles belonged to Mr. Clay, his niece
Miss M. Z. Sinclair, and Miss C. D. Dag
gett. who recently came from her home in
Southern California to visit the Clay
family.
Humel claimed to have recently come
from Port Costa, where he had been
working, and his indiscriminate stealing
of everything handy and his ready confes

The decorations of Native Sons' Hall
on the occasion of the invitation ball
given by PaciMc Parlor No. 10 was an ex
quisit* conception of the decorator's art,
Mr. Pratt, a member of the parlor, being
tho artist. In addition to the effects in
light, shades on the galleries*, the central
piece was a delicately arranged affair.
which produced a very pleasing effect,
while the stasre effect was most attrac
tive. The central piece was the name of
the parlor in red incandescent lights, and
the glow from this reflected on all objects
was subdued and exceedingly pleasing to
the eye. The stage proper was a forest of
exquisite living plants and foliage, while
the ladles" parlor and the vestibule were
made pretty with floral decorations. The
souvenir programme was in white and
royal purple, with California's chosen
flower, the golden poppy, embossed in
natural color on the front and back. The
grand march was led by President T. P.
Martin and his wife.

worked a sharp rally. Some stocks were at

at the ruilv. The bears found Pacific Mall
vulnerable to further attack and had some
success with People's Gas, but Third Avenue

side public maintained an apathetic attitude
toward the market. Last week's reduction in
prices when the news was all favorable caused
doubt and distrust in the minds of outsiders
and they have refused to come back into the
market this week. The public apathy has been
a weight on thÂ© market and the weakness of
Individual etocks from special causes haa been
a further disturbing factor. The failure of
plans to fund the floating debt of the Third
Avenue Railroad Company; a poor season for
the rubber business, owing to the fine weather;
Intimations of a coming suspension of cash
dividends on the Pacific Mall; a report of a
bond Issue by Continental Tobacco, to take up
stock of a new constituent companyâ these were
some of the causes which created weakness
In a few stocks and checked the advancing
tendency In the general list. Add to these a
disposition to caution about overstraining the
money market. In view of the heavy demands
making upon it for use in the regular chan
nels of business and the renewed absorption
by the Treasury of the re\-enue surplus since
Internal revenue receipts are flowing once more
into the treasury Instead of Into depository
banks, and the factors of reaction are most of,
them enumerated. On the other hand are de
tails of prosperity from all sides. Current rail
road earnings are at an unprecedented level
and the volume of merchandise traffic Is undl
mlnlshed. In spite of higher rates In effect,
thus more than offsetting & smaller movement
In grain and some other agricultural pro
ducts. The working out of plans for domi
nance In control of competing lines by great
railroad systems gives evidence of progress,
especially In the southern group of trunk lines,
and the outlines of an agreement among the
two great trunk lines for divisions of terri
tory are seen to emerge. The foreign trade
statement for January. Issued by the Treas
ury Bureau of Statistics, shows that thÂ«s for
eign demand for manufactures is well main
tained, in spite of the high levÂ«l of prices rul
ing, and the vnlue of cotton exports is so far
enhanced in spite, of continued small volume
as to largely offset the discrepancy between
agricultural exports of preceding months and
those of the previous year. The world's large
needs for cotton are believed to Insure a good
market, not only for the moving crop, but for
the coming one. with a corresponding Increase
In the buying power of the cotton sections of
the country.
The lltlgatlnus outbreaks between operators
In one of the largest steel companies have
brought to public notice assertions regarding
last year's profits in the trade and estimates
of the coming year's profits, placing them at
astounding proportions. The slocks of compa
nies in the iron and steel Industry have ad
vanced In the market In consequence in spite
of the continued discrimination against them
as collateral by banks and money lenders.
Professional operators In stocks have professed
s^me satisfaction over the passage of the finan
cial hill through the Senate, but the general In
terest In the subject at Its present stage has
seemed listless in financial circles. The ef
fect In this market of the favorable devel
opments in the British campaign In South
Africa has been moderate. ..

London Wool Sales.
NEW YORK, Feb. 17.â The Financier says:
The yurplus reserve of the New York Clear
ing Hou*e banks was reduced $3, 551, 900 ' last
week, owing to a. loss of $2,324,200 to the Treas
ury and the interior and to the increased re
serve requirements necessitated by a rise of
$6,231,200 in deposits. The statement was about
In line with what the week's operations had
foreshadowed, so far as cash changes were
concerned, but the rain of 513,684,200 In loans,
following the unprecedented Increase of $21,
000,000 for the week previous, attracted some
attention. It is conceded that the expansion
in loans reported February 10 was dvÂ« In part
to borrowings from commÂ«rlcal sources, an
unusually large number of banks having par
ticipated in the movement. The currency state
ment, however, when subjected to closer anal
ysis, reveals the fact that the new loans were
maiie by a few of the more prominent banks,
ona institution alone accounting for nearly
half the gain. The significant fact In connec
tion with the statement is the stoppage of in
tertcr receipts and the resumption of payments
In the Treasury. So far from gaining money
from the Interior, the New York banks laÂ»t
week actually shipped considerable funds to
other cities, and the Treasury losses amounted
to over one and one-half millions. This Is
likely to be a continuing process, and with the
added bufden of carrying larger commitments,
due to current business demands, the inference
is that the banks' surplus will be drawn up
materially before spring,. Money rates, of
course, will be dependent on the extent of these
calls, but a market, it is conceded, must fol
low unless the movements of money are at
variance with known facts. Last year at this
period the surplus reserves of the banks had
already begun to decline and the fail did not
stop until In April, when the lo*s ot excess
reserves amounted to twenty millions. Over a
third of this sum had been absorbed In caring
for Increased deposits and the trend of banking
now seems to be following closely the same
lines.

CHICAGO, Feb. 17.â With Liverpool , and
Partg loVer, Northwest receipts liberal and
world's shipments expected to Â»how an increase
Monday. May wheat started the day He under
yesterday at -68*Â»c. Some covering by shorts
early sent the price to 68HÂ®^8Hc but this waa
lost. The seaboard reported only . ten loads
taken for export. It was reported that the Ar
gentine plague had been stamped out. The
cash demand was slack and speculative trade
small. May eased oft to 68Uc, where the mar
ket held for sonic time, with some outside de
mand for May. The local talent' waa bearish,
however, and the cloÂ«e was weak, May U<g%c
under yesterday at eS^sSSS^c.
Corn opened easy, had a spasm of firmness
and. then relapsed into its original state. Sym
pathy with wheat, a bit more liberality in
country offerings, lower cables and some pro
fit-taking by longs were influences. May closed
a shade under yesterday at 34%@34%c. .
Oats were easy with corn. The market was
â¢mall. .May closed Uc down at 23-% c. Ther*
was some buying by shorts. Provisions were
dull, and the price suffered a little in conse
quence. The feature waÂ» quietness of specula
tion. There was no noteworthy trade. May
pork closed 24Â©5 c under yesterday; May lard
closed a. shade down, and May ribs closed 3Hc
lower. '.-..â¢

Some boys reported to Patrolman Fer
guson yesterday afternoon that three men
in a vacant lot on the corner of Powell
and North Point streets were engaged In
boiling portion^ of a human body In a
wash boiler. The officer made an Inves

of 114 Guerrero street and Benjamin M.

VASE STOLEN FROM THE
CALIFORNIA RECOVERED
Lucien Koch Arrested Charged With
Stealing: the Art Treasure From
the Hotel.
The man who stole the big vase from
the parlors of the California Hotel some
time between Monday night and early
Tuesday morning is believed to be Lu
cien Koch, an Alsatian, 26 years of age.
He was arrested late Kfriday night by De
tectives Harper and Sullivan and Police
man J. Sullivan, and the vase was recov
ered Thursday from a pawnbroker on
Lombard street.
The pawnbroker said a stranger sold
him the vase last Tuesday, getting $30 for
it. He suspected that all was not right
and telephoned to police headquraters and
was informed that they had no report of
such a vase being stolen Then when the
news of the robbery was made public he,
notified the police and gave a? description
of the man who sold it, which- led to
Koch's arrest. The latter was Identified,
by tha pawnbroker. Two bronze busts
also stolen from the hotel and. a water
proof coat and silk lined overcoat had
also been pawned by Koch.
The vase stands over, three, feet' high,
weighs about 100 pounds and Is valued at
$400. How it could have been carried out
of the hotel without detection is a. mys
tery. Koch says that he bought the busts
from an Italian whom he did not know,
about eight days ago for $4, and last Mon
day or Tuesday the Italian again called af
his room on Geary street, near Powell,
with the big. vase, which he purchased for
$5. He did not ask the Italian any ques
tions as to where he had got the articles."
The waterproof and overcoat, he said,
were brought by him from Paris. . .
Koch told the detectives that he catne
here from Paris about five months ago
and had â¢ been playing .the races. His
father, he said, was a brewer in Stras
burg, Germany, and sent him a remit
tance of $60 , per month through the
French Consul here. He at first denied
knowing anything about the stolen arti
cles, but later gave out the;story about
buying them- from an Italian. He admit
ted having: visited the California Hotel to
ccc a friend, Captain Schultz. Yesterday
morning he was booked on, a charge of
grand larceny and two charges of petty
larceny. The detectives believe that he
Is a hotel sneak thief and are trying to
find owners for the waterproof and over
coat. The capture is looked upon as an
